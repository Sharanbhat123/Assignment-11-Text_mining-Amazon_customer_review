Review
Ive been a Crapple guy since the Moto Razor....but Im so tired of their proprietary BS with MY Music That I PAID for. I am phasing them out  replaced my iPad and my third iPhone like the other two were acting sketchy ( blue screen of death and the jitters on the X) and when this laptop is soon to get replaced as well) Apple nows how to present their goods  kinda like Tiffany but w/o the diamond. Anyway while the packaging is as nice the S20 fe is Amazing. Easy to learn  fantastic camera and switching all my contacts  calendars and numbers took seconds without a cable! the best part at least to me was the pleasant surprise of finding that when I changed over my sims card that I could also install a hell of a lot of memory behind the sims card (I installed a gig card as that was all I had kicking around for my digital camera) and you can have your files and photo saved directly to it! Brilliant! I have to say that 90% of the apps I had on the X I down loaded through the google and Samsung apps stores so I now have two stores vice one which is nice and both verify the apps are virus free. It is also 5G which will be nice when I get it in this area and I also understand that this phone is good for overseas travel on vacations or business. The apps that come with this phone are intuitive unlike Crapple which I never mastered. This isn t simple by any means but it is much easier to learn once you down load the book from the web. Bottom Line? Wish I listened to my friends instead of being a snob and bought a Sammy earlier! And at almost Half the coast!!!
Do not buy red phone if you have tmobile or sprint it is not compatible! Even though it is in the description that it works with them we went to 3 different tmobile locations and had the issue escalated to find out that the entire line of the red phone are not compatible. I submitted my refund and they recieved the item on July 2 its now July 14 and I have yet to get my money back. No response when I sent a message to them either.
I ve always been a Samsung guy  but my last phone was a MOTO Z3 Play. It was nice  but weak camera and battery was getting bad at 30 months  phone also acting buggy even after factory reset... This S20 FE blows the MOTO away. It really is the perfect screen size! Not too big! WOW the 5G is incredible!!!!!! Camera is great and I m demanding... 120Hz is just the best  do not downplay this  it s smooth as butter.... love the screen print scanner  it s flawless no matter what people say  just keep re-entering same thumb as finger one  two and three  it reall is flawlewss if you do that... AMOLED screen is just BEAUTIFUL! Gorrilla Galss 3 is a must... battery life is great  I m on it a lot and still 40-50% by end of day... supplied charger is plenty fast enough... menu is bloated and complicated  but manageable... LOVE the stereo speakers! Just an all around great experience... no need to get the S20. Great price here... sold by and shipped by Amazon  what more do you want??
Edit: I m a super heavy user. I m at about the 6 month  and now the device gets warm when it s taxed or the weather is a little warm. And the battery life  whuch is still great  and dropped down significantly. Love the phone. Very concerned about the longevity. Particularly as i come up on summer in floridamark Edit: one month in  and I love it! Battery lasts all day  and I m on my phone nonstop.I m used to the change in buttons and actually like them. Put in settings so power options do come up now. Like the screenshot method  mostly.Got a supcase military grade unicorn beetle case so it s well protected. Signal is great on tmobile. 5g is slower than 4g  so I turn it off. but I m out in the middle of nowhere.Touch screen works perfectly even under double acreen protectors! Updates get sent all the time. So worth it!And my mom is blown away by the telephoto lens. For me it s a fun binoculars  but pretty mushy picture quality at telephoto distance. S9 couldn t do that at all. The close up distance/focus is much better than my s9. The rest is pretty similar.---It s only been a couple days but so far so good. None of the touch screen or overheating issues a few people listed on the internet.I took very good care of my S9  but it was overheating often. This is night and day difference.I thought the volume buttons above the power button would take some getting used to  but actually the only downside is taking a screenshot is more difficult. Oh  and the power button no longer turns it off! Although I ve read There are some workarounds for that. Otherwise you have to go up in the menu.I love that it s the same width as my old phone  but taller. Gives me more space but I can still hold it.I absolutely hate that there are no good colorful heavy duty cases out for it yet. Come on OtterBox!I wanted to go with the S10 because I was nervous reading reviews  and how new this was. But this was cheaper  and so far I m very happy with my choice.Please note  red it definitely an orangey red. I went with red so it would be more visible if all I could find for now was transparent cases. But if I could go back I would definitely choose purple again.I ve also read a lot of people turn the 5G off because it s not available everywhere and you don t really want it constantly switching between 4G and 5G. 5G was coming in pretty good for me out in the boonies with T-Mobile. I did switch it to 4G yesterday and that also worked fine during a trip.Transferring information using Smart Switch actually worked really well for me. My S9 main Drive was completely full. The SD card was half full. This brought over ALMOST everything perfectly  and it wasn t even very slow. The only things it didn t bring over were paid apps that I had installed with a different Google account. I had to add the rest of my Google accounts and do those by hand. Not sure if that would have been any different had I installed all the Google accounts first.I would say it s very slightly brighter than my S9. I don t have a problem with the camera being on the screen.Haven t had great luck with a fingerprint yet  but I do need to redo it since I put a screen protector on anyways.Happy happy!
I had this phone for 2 months! I cannot use the camera anymore and I get  Warning: Camera Failed ! I tried every trick and reset and nothing worked! I had Sumsung Tech connect to my phone and they couldn t fix it. Simply put Samsung knows there is an issue and are reluctant to make it public. I am a very light user and very knowledgeable user and based on all sites I found where users are posting the exact similar issue  I wish I knew before buying this worthless phone but will never buy another Samsung product again. This was quickly baked and released to the market to make $$$$. No accountability Samsung! None! Please release a fix immediately or offer to exchange these clunkers that are less than 3 months old! Before you buy just google Warning Camera Failed....100 s of new owners posted the issue. I also posted on Samsung s community web site. And  Samsung never called me back after not being able to fix it!
I ve been using touchscreen phones about as long as anyone else. Many years. This screen is a little weird. Sometimes it won t track my finger completely  when I m scrolling text. It s really disconcerting.The fingerprint reader doesn t work as well as older Samsung phones where it was on the back of the phone. Those worked almost always... maybe once every couple days it would need a second read.This one  probably 10-20 times per day it won t read my fingerprint right  and I have to do it a second  third  or fourth time. Occasionally it will even refuse to read so many times in a row I have to draw my pattern to unlock.Final problem: when I m taking pictures with it  sometimes the camera app will  freeze  for 10-15 seconds at a time. It will seem like it s working  but just won t take a picture  no matter how many times I jam that take-a-picture button on the screen. Really annoying to lose 15 seconds of shots because the camera app sucks.One time it stayed  frozen  so long that the  camera app has stopped responding  thing popped up.
I love this phone. The camera system could be the best out presently. The ability to add memory. I can  not imagine what I DON T yet know about this outstanding phone. The reception and clarity are great. Noise and dropouts have yet to happen. This is a very fast operating phone. The sound is great. Got mine on sale for $599.99 (Amazon) and could not be happier. Amazon is an authorized seller. Avoid 3rd party s if you want the warranty intact. Contact any dealer before you buy to be certain the phone is new and under full warranty. Samsung can also answer this. Be sure to put a good protective cover on it. Also. Some complain that when they install a screen protector the tough sensitivity and fingerprint ID don t work well. There is a simple menu setting to adjust touch sensitivity under SETTING s. This solves the issue. Even without a case  this is a well built phone. But use a lanyard so if you do drop it  it won t hit the ground. Best phone out there for the money. 5g ready and acts as a hot pot too.
I chose this phone after using my GS8 beyond its service life. I only buy a new phone every few years when. I ve owned several Galaxy phones in the past and have always been satisfied. This phone does it all. Good battery  good screen  good camera  fast charging  4k video  good audio  good looks  multiple colors  SD card support  wireless charging  wireless power sharing  facial unlock  etc. I have never had any issues with this phone. This is by far my favorite phone ever. If I lost it today I would buy it again without hesitation. I did a lot of research before getting this  and when it was announced  I knew it would be the perfect phone for me. If you re considering this phone  please look up  MKBHD S20FE  on YouTube. He highlights a lot of things about this phone and they also gave it the phone of the year award. You cannot beat this value for what you re getting. I love it!
Upgraded from an S9+ and while I was admittedly missing my old phone at first  the S20 FE has quickly won me over. The fingerprint reader works great  the screen is nice. I love the 120hz refreshrate. The camera is excellent with more features and capabilities than I know what to do with. The phone is slim; I put a thin case and some cheap screen protectors on the front and camera and it still feels nice. It is wider than the S9+  so that took some getting used to. The phone is quick and responsive and I have never felt that I am wanting for processing power or RAM. If you use your phone for basic things  this will suit you just fine.
I was so excited to get my Galaxy S20 FE phone as it was an upgrade from the S8 I ve had for years. I purchased the US version Unlocked and took it to my local US Cellular store to have a clerk switch everything from my S8 to the S20. I was told by the clerk after she attempted to get the phone registered and set up with US Cellular that the phone was not compatible with the network. According to the Amazon add this phone is supposed to be compatible with US Cellular so I do not know if I was getting a line of BS from the US Cellular clerk because I didn t purchase the phone through them (even though they no longer carry the S20 FE) or if it s false advertisement on Amazon (hence the 2 star rating). I was so livid yesterday after leaving the US Cellular store that I just went home  started the return process to send this phone back to Amazon  boxed it up and dropped it off at the local UPS Store. If I want to upgrade my phone I guess I m stuck with purchasing a phone through US Cellular so I know it will work. I m looking at the Galaxy A52 as it s similar in price to the Cloud Navy S20FE that I purchased through Amazon. I refuse to pay $1 000+ for an S series phone.😠
Coming from a pixel 2 I expected more.Front camera is slow and very blurry in low-lightvibration intensity is pathetic  I keep missing calls.it s obnoxiously largefingerprint scanner is inconsistent at best  even without any screen protection (if anyone had one in stock)Samsung s version of android is garbage  I actually downgraded from Android 11 to 10battery life is better than my ancient phone.wifi6 is fast  about 300Mbps testedWifi6 Stats:Channel 40 (11ax)Signal 94% (-53 dBm)Rx Rate 960 MbpsTx Rate 648 MbpsPower Save Enabled5G is decent (LTE+ indicated at 100Mbps down  4Mbps up  AT&T in Raleigh  NC)If you you like Samsung s spin on android and large screens this is a great phone for you.

I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One  and most obviously  was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it)  it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so  I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance  the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen  while not 4K  still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good  nice and crisp. I ve done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography  all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid  but not the best in the market right now. You ll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also  you can t beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support)  you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size  while much larger than I was used to  still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though  as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But  if you ve been reading up on the S20 FE at all  then you know that there are problems. First off  the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself  I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls  that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I d say it works about 85% of the time  but when it doesn t  do you ever feel it. Adding on  the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad  but it s not flagship levels by any stretch. You ll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you re looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with  I d look elsewhere.From what I ve seen  the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes  my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There s undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released  but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no  at least for me. While I m sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers)  I really haven t noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter  but that s about all I ve seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE  I don t blame you.It really is a shame that I can t give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars  because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues  there s always the worry that time will make them worse. It s a genuine worry  I get that. But even with the problems  the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone  but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse  but for right now  I m more than happy with it.Edit (8/18/2021): I ve dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It s been a little less than a year  and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay  maybe not daily use  per se. But enough that it s starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket  it s opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen  as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here s the cold  honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone s screen. It s beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic  angry Amazon customer 1-star  review  but I ll refrain. There s still good here with the chip  customizability  and great battery life  but that stuff can only get you so far.Here s my advice: don t bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price  with better specs. It s still not the worst thing out there and I m not tossing it in the trash just yet  but it s definitely the last Samsung product I ll be buying. So disappointing  but I couldn t keep this review a 4-star in good conscience.
When I purchased this it was listed as 8gb of ram but the model I received is 6gb. That makes me feel lured into something I wasn t expecting.The phone is a solid overall phone with premium performance for the price due to sacrificing the build quality by making the back plastic and the screen gorilla glass 3 instead of 6.Doesn t matter to me as I wanted an unused device (battery) with a top notch processor for the smallest price point.I m still slightly upset about not getting 8gb as was listed when I purchased which is why I didn t rate 5/5.
Never again will I buy another Samsung phone. My Galaxy S8+ is superior in every way except 5G. This phone reeks internal design contest by 1st year interns. Goodbye Samsung.
The media could not be loaded.  This was the perfect phone until I started wondering what was wrong with my screen. Your touchs will be misread causing random inputs and jitter. This is a recording of how the phone is recognizing my inputs when using two fingers in alternating succession as well as when swiping with two fingers. This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games  the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8. The most recent software update to fix the issue has made no difference. If you buy this phone it WILL have this problem. I was originally in the group that assumed mine wasn t affected  but it became hard to ignore the signs after a week.
Just got this yesterday  the day it came out. I got the Navy Blue  which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel s battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates  I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a  but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen  huge battery  and top-of-the-line processor for $600  that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what s in the Pixel line  it s not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn t as good  and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost  but I feel that the Pixel software doesn t add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else  it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two.
When I pre-order the description was 8 GB Ram but I received with 6 GB. I checked the description back and found it have been changed from 8 GB to 6 GB. This is so weird.
This phone seemed like it had it all for an unbeatable price of $550. Big battery  120 hz  good cameras  recent cpu  and okay ram. Well all this stuff would have made this phone a keeper except the touch screen issues. This is literally how the user communicates with the phone and allows you to access all these great features. Really stinks that an issue this big slipped through. Samsung has released 3 software updates trying to fix it  but still have problems with jittery scrolling  accidental touches  etc. This isn t something that can be fixed with an update in my opinion or it would be resolved by now. Look elsewhere  or if your brave chance it I guess. I thought I would get lucky despite all the bad reviews/complaints (check samsung forums). I don t mean to be a downer but I strongly advise to choose a different phone. I m still looking myself. Good luck!
Took the phone to a Verizon store as soon as I received it and after 30 minutes of the rep trying to activate it he called Verizon tech support and was told the phone had no registered ESN and could not be activated on their network. The phone also appeared to have been used as it had scratches in the end and was missing the sim card key. Am returning the phone.
I ve owned the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G for several months now and love it. Initially  I didn t like that it didn t include Wifi calling but that was eventually added to my surprise during an update. This was huge since my mom lives in bad cell phone coverage area. The battery is excellent. I haven t received any negative audio comments from anyone during voice call. The camera is excellent. Although it has 5G capability  I don t know when or if it is in use - It lacks an icon. Oh  the top  ribbon  is a little tough to read. Its a great phone and at a great price. My wife likes it more than her iPhone.
Overall  I like the phone. It s fast  stable  and feature packed. I replaced an older LG G8 and this is my first Samsung phone since the original Galaxy (which I was horrible for me). I bought this because it supports an SD Card and was otherwise a relatively inexpensive  yet full featured phone.If I have one notable complaint  it s how the camera physically protrudes from the phone. Not much  but it prevents it from sitting flat on a surface (unless I have it in a case). This might be necessary for the camera s features and the  thinness  of the phone  but it makes me concerned about scratching the camera glass. While there are glass screen protectors for the camera glass  they don t stay on well unless appropriately protected in a case.Overall very good  but I don t like how the phone makes me concerned about damaging the camera area and doesn t otherwise sit flat outside of a case.
Very happy with this item. This phone was reasonably priced and had all the features I was looking for. I put a glass screen protector on it as soon as I got it and a gel type case. I will say though  the glass screen protector does affect fingerprint recognition somewhat. Out of the box  the fingerprint sensor works great  but with the screen protector  it misreads the fingerprint maybe 1/5 of the time. But that s not a limitation on the phone  just the screen protector. Otherwise I m very happy. Display is beautiful and battery life is amazing!
struggled trying to take out the sim card holder. once i put in my verizon card  it did not work. then i had a heck of the time retrieving the sim card so that the phone can be returned. data transfer from note 8 was easy. other than that it is incompatible with verizon carrier. its more than disapointing considering my business is built on prompt response.
This phone is disappointing. The camera is the only good feature (which is truly awesome BTW). The phone has many glitches. It doesn t always stay connected to the WiFi in standby mode  it will just give me a blank screen sometimes and need to be restarted  and MMS sometimes won t go through without restarting the phone. These are the issues I ve had in the first month. I ve also even killed the battery a few days. I had decided to return it  but just missed the cut off. What a joke of a phone!This is my 5th or 6th Samsung Galaxy  and the 1st one that has not been worth it. I will not be purchasing another Samsung phone.
So let s start with the screen. It s beautiful  responsive  reads my fingerprints accurately. And it s got a lot of functionality with pip and other features.Next up is signal. I live in a rural area so service is tricky  but this beast finds signal in all but the most taxing of conditions  inside a manufacturing plant for example.Camera is on the list too  don t worry here we are. Overall it s a good camera. It s not the best camera out the  but it does a very fine job of trying to be the best. Many filters and functions await you here.The battery is impressive. I m kinda hard on my phone battery  and this one could take the abuse. Fairly quick charging off a wall jack or portable battery with plenty of active use time. You get more features here too with power sharing and highly tunable battery saving options.All in all  I m very satisfied with the phone and I m sure many others feel the same.P.S. That Snapdragon is a monster.
I have not had this phone for long; maybe a few months in with this device. The battery life is impeccable for me! I am a young person. That being said  I am on my phone very often. I have watched hours of movies  YouTube videos  and shows. I am not much of a tech nerd but I can say that compared to my old phone the battery lasts more than all day  after countless hours using it.I originally bought this type of phone because I hoped that it would not be obsolete in two years like my old LG K10. I also bought this phone for it s DeX feature. You can basically turn your phone into a computer desktop if you have a projector or desktop computer/laptop using an HDMI cord to type-C. This is an awesome device! The screen is very colorful and watching videos on it is perfect!I must say that this phones fingerprint reader is horrendous. It has only read my fingerprint about 62% of the time. I really do not care about it  because my old phone never even had that feature. I have not tried the face recognition feature yet.Something that I do not like is the back camera sticks out from the phone a little. I would recommend you get a phone case right away  or at least get camera and screen protectors ASAP. If you drop your phone one good time without a case and protectors  your whole phone would probably malfunction. The cameras I think would shatter internally.
I really liked this phone at first. It was somewhat too large but had lots of very nice features. Then  after owning it 3-weeks  bad things started to happen. During calls the screen would keep going dark after 10-sec. I contacted Samsung and the tech could do nothing to fix this issue. He said they were working on it and needed to re-included an app that they removed but had no alternative. Then  the answer and hang-up buttons stopped working completely and the phone wouldn t shut off. Finally I had enough of this not-ready-for primetime piece of nonsense made by Samsung - a company that I had always respected. Fortunately I was able to return the phone through Amazon.
You would think for paying over 600.00 for a phone they could at least put a protective case on the damn thing. I didn t even have it 1 day andropped it in the sand from only 2 feet up and the entire front of the phone shattered and busted the glass and the phone went dead. WTF?
Ok so I switched to this phone from a Google Pixel 3a. I set it up June 30th a day after I got it. The first problem was that my incoming messages from several people were time stamped as three hours before I received them when the reality was that we were having a real time conversation. This is still a problem but today I have encountered another issue wherein the phone will not stop rebooting. It still does it in safe mode and the battery charger trick didn t do it either. Which means I will have to do another factory reset on this phone. The only reason this review has more than one star is because I used to be a Samsung stan before I got the pixel. If the factory reset doesn t work or if i can t do it before the phone reboots I am going to try and return it  this isn t ok.*Update: I did the factory reset and it didn t work. We are downto one star because this is not something I am ok with.
The phone works well as a phone  past the 5G switching not being completely worked out  but that is a carrier issue. I am a Sprint customer and because of the merger and network confusion my phone thinks a 5/5 Sprint 4G LTE signal is roaming and tried to grab the 1 bar TMobile signal..Now for the showstopper. The touch hardware is complete and utter trash. The October firmware update helped a bit. The sensor array is in a horizontal/Vertical grid. If you touch three points on the screen and slide any of those fingers past the same grid line as another finger  it drops the moving touch . 4 out of 10 times  and strobes like a series of taps the other 6. The strobing lasts for 1/10 second or so. I used developer mode to show touches and can watch the touch just disappear. Now if I place two fingers on each side of the screen so they re both on the same horizontal plane  and then move a third finger between them it drops touch and then strobes every single time.This really looks like an issue from the early days when companies were struggling to get multi finger gestures to reliably work. Perhaps Samsung used a design made in 2006-2008 to maximize profits. Shameful.I pre-ordered this phone. I have never preordered any piece of hardware. I did it because  Samsung knows howmto make a phone. That is one thing they get right  unless it explodes... . Well  apparently Samsung forgot how to make a touchscreen screen.... Yes  Samsung. A screen. That s your thing... You make screens. You screwed that up like a first time manufacturer. And then you decided to sell it anyway. You even mentioned  Games  in your advertising.This is my third Galaxy S10 FE with this same issue. Initial phone was Sprint branded (returned)  second was unlocked (waited two weeks for more information and spent over an hour on the phone with Samsung  the Requested replacement)  replacement phone has same exact issue. Failing 3/3 of the time... That looks like 1... Yup. 100% failure rate. This is after the October firmware update that was supposed to fix the touch bugs.
This phone was intended to be a considerable upgrade for me. It replaced a 5 year old Nexus 6p. I will not deny that many aspects of it are better. It is undeniably faster. The modified version of Android  Samsung s One UI  does not impress. It feels like bloat and has made some features harder to find. The through display fingerprint reader feels about 50% as reliable as a rear reader. The area that reads is very small (as is the area on a back reader)  but there is no physical surface feature to help you put your finger in the correct position. Most annoying to me is the lack of a headphone jack. I bought the phone knowing I d give that up  but I assumed the only penalty of the usb-c to heaphone adapter would be the cost of purchasing one. The sound quality is far inferior through an adapter as compared to my previous phones with standard headphone jacks. Additionally using the adapter off of the power input port (usb-c) means your headphone cord comes out the bottom of the phone which is more annoying that I would have thought.
The Samsung has 20 at the 5G is the best value for the money.I upgraded from a Motorola G7 to this Samsung S20 5G unlocked. My carrier is Verizon Wireless. All I had to do was install a new SIM card and this phone works beautifully. I am able to get 5G where available and it took me awhile to become familiar with Samsung apps but now I really like using Samsung apps instead of Google apps.But I m amazed of how hard it is to learn a different ecosystem. I almost sent the phone back because I was under the impression that I needed the Google apps that I was used to using.Thankfully I hung in there and learned something new.Samsung makes great hardware and software. Samsung is going to give competition to the to the likes of Amazon  Google and Microsoft.Each phone company wants you to use their apps and it took me a month or two to get used to this because at first I thought they re forcing me to use their apps. I don t want bloatware  but as I became familiar with Samsung apps they work flawlessly with their products.The other thing is the camera on this Samsung is outstanding and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Samsung has hooked me.The phone also works flawlessly with the Samsung Galaxy watches.Excellent customer service and support.
Got this phone (S20 FE) after i used my S9 for almost 3 years. I felt the upgrade after 2 weeks of use ( or even in an lesser time)  the s20 fe is not a phone you can easily hold with one hand  the plastic back may seem cheap  but  it grows on you  also it won t break as easily like a glass back. The front camera doesn t disturb you when you are watching videos  movies  pic etc. Gaming  it will run very smoothly. Battery  if the phone starts at 100%  by the end of the day it won t be fully dead (even if you have the 120hz screen  which is like spreading butter on bread  you won t go back to 60hz after using the 120hz).Once you get to play with the phone itself  you will notice this cellphone can compete or even win its sisters like the s20 or the s20 plus (heck it can probably bit the iphone11 just with its extra perks)For the price you get  you won t get rip off. It s nice that you can this phone at an reasonable price and not spend 1k on a phone that can do the same thing.Highly recommend if you want a good Phone and for a great price!!!
I ended up returning this phone. It s a really good phone but I just personally didn t like how lightweight it felt and how large it was  or that the case was plastic. It s a very beautiful color though. My biggest complaint is the camera quality. I am an artist and I just need my pictures to be perfect  I use the iPhone SE 2nd gen and in my opinion the camera on it is much better. The S20 FE camera is a bit lighter  a bit less saturated  and almost...grainy? I only notice when I zoom in on fine pencil lines etc. but I ve heard other reviews complaining of the same differences. Anyway  if you want a feather light  huge  very pretty phone with a pretty good but not perfect camera  this phone is okay. Just not worth $600 to me personally.
This is a beautiful  capable  reasonable smartphone  but the particular one I received would not charge on my third-party wireless charger  either with or without the Samsung silicone case. I ordered a 15 W Samsung wireless charging stand  but that failed in the same manner  Attempts to get help from Samsung s support organization resulted in an erroneous conclusion that the 15W charger did not support the S20 series of phones  but the newer 9W version did  so I ordered the 9W charger...and got the same results. I concluded that the problem had to be with the QI system within the phone  and initiated a return procedure to Amazon  intending to request a simple  return and replace with identical item   but that option was not available for the phone. Amazon indicated that to speed up the process  I should chat with their specialists before simply returning the phone for credit. After a one-hour  chat  with Amazon technical help  who finally transferred me to Samsung technical help  who spent another hour before they concluded that I should take the phone to a Samsung-approved service center  which is 2.5 hours away  with no assurance that they could resolve the problem; even less probability they could resolve the problem in the same day...I processed the standard return-to-Amazon-for credit application. Then with a confirmation that the return was approved  I simply ordered another (identical) phone. On it s arrival  I quickly transferred all app  data  etc from the old phone to the new phone  swapped the SIM carrier (containing the SIM card and the external memory card). The new phone charges easily and quickly on both Samsung wireless chargers  even with the Samsung cover on the phone. Using the straight-forward Amazon process is simple and efficient  but when people get involved  the efficiency is subject to total loss  simplicity is gone  and patience becomes a victim.
The SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G is my first true flagship phone I have ever bought. I have been a Motorola user with my last being the Moto 5G Plus. That lasted only 2 years and then moved so slow and functioned so poorly I knew I had to research and move into the big leagues. I am so thrilled with every aspect of this phone. Its screen is vibrant and colorful. Its video quality is superb and scrolling around and going between apps it moves like lightning. I am extremely impressed with the camera and video quality as well. Some complain about the selfie camera. At first I was not happy but did my research on how to use all its features and now I am beyond thrilled. Everything here far surpasses all my expectations. Phone call quality is excellent and the audio from the speakers also shines. Bluetooth connectivity is a breeze and music and audio books sound excellent. This is all enough for me to love this phone but add in the battery life and it becomes a true winner. With excessive use I get at least a full day out of it. I never got half a day with my Motorola. I have installed a 128 gb sd card for quality amount of storage. This phone never falters and performs at the highest level all the time. Finally I have a true quality phone and I just love having it and using it. Highly recommend.
Best of what the S20 has to offer in a cheaper build. When I say cheap  I mean lower cost and not necessarily bad quality. The plastic back is the best kind of plastic back you will get on a smartphone  definitely worth the price cut. It s actually better since you don t have to worry about it cracking if you drop it. Optical fingerprint scanner is a tad slower than what I m used to  coming from the S8  but not slow and doesn t always unlock the first time. Battery life is what makes this phone great  lasts all day. I go to bed with about 35 to 45 percent left  go to sleep  wake up the battery has not drained and I charge it up in the morning before work. And with 120hz on all day. Fast screen is also another highlight  so much smoother than my S8. Cameras great  not a professional camera reviewer  go check out reviews on YouTube.
I m a diehard Android user coming from a Galaxy s7  and I wanted to treat myself to a brand new phone since I haven t been first owner of a phone since probably 2009. I spent months debating between Galaxy s10 or s20 series  but couldn t stomach spending almost a grand on a phone. When I saw this s20 FE was released with all the bells and whistles of the $1000 phone and for a more reasonable price  I had to go for it. The phone came undamaged  no scratches or smudges or anything. The battery life is great. I have a lot of screen time throughout the day  and by the time I go to bed at night I still have within the 70% range of battery left. The cameras are cool  but I haven t had a chance to really mess with the features all that much yet. I love that it works with my wireless charger. The display features are awesome. There are little things you can adjust to really make it your own customized phone. If you are debating on getting this phone  DO IT! It is totally worth the money and you won t be disappointed!
I was overdue for an upgrade phone. I usually buy ones that have been out for a couple of years. But the unlocked price of this phone sparked my interest. Not many reviews yet  but so far I am pleased. I Use TracFone and have no regrets. You get the same service as you do with being a major network customer.
Im upgrading from a Note 8 to this so needless to say its a very welcome upgrade overall except for a few things. Battery life is much better considering how old my Note 8 is. Screen is a downgrade as its only 1080 over my 1440 but still great for what it is. The fingerprint reader is a double edged sword for me. Coming from a note 8  the position of the reader is an upgrade (the reader on the note is on the rear of the phone) but its reliability is iffy. Sometimes itll recognize immediately and other times it takes it a while to recognize it. This is a common issue documented elsewhere as well but not a deal breaker. The biggest issue for me is the camera. While the camera is better than the note 8s on paper  in the real world im having issues with it. The focus is terrible  especially while using flash. The camera consistently gets confused as to where it needs to focus and flash pictures are completely unuseable. Overall a great phone but decide if what I described is a deal breaker for you
This unlocked phone has so many bugs! The touch screen is unresponsive 30% of the time. The phone will freeze for no apparent reason. The internet gets dropped no matter if you re on 5G  LTE  4G  3G or 2G.Besides all that  if you want a sleek and slim phone case with a kickstand  we ll tie gonna have to wait because they don t exist. Only the big  bulky brick in your pocket case with kickstands exists at the moment.Bottom line... This phone was put out on the market before everything was ready.
I was worried based on some reviews this was difficult to activate. I did it within 45 minutes of unpacking the device. I transferred using Smart Switch app  watched YouTube video on how to move sim card from my old phone to my new phone and the new phone works great. No Verizon calls  no Verizon store. This was my first cell phone purchase not made directly with Verizon. I had worries but Amazon has a return policy that made decision easier knowing that was an option if I couldn t figure it out. No new contract with Verizon is a BIG bonus!
I ve had this phone 11 days and it was supposed to be an upgrade for me from a cheaper brand of smartphones. The cheaper brand was good  but didn t last long. Now I miss those cheap ones.My new 20 FE 5G sometimes won t read my fingerprint. Annoying  but I just enter my pin.However  last night I tried and failed - over and over - to copy and paste something. It appeared to copy  but kept pasting the previous text I d copied.I don t have a lot of money and this was a stretch for me. Now I m stuck with a crappy phone.EDIT I ve now had this phone 3-3½ months and  without exaggeration  I can say I hate it.An alarm began ringing today and it only stopped when I turned off the phone.Calls come in and I only know I ve gotten them when I find a voicemail or look at Recent Calls.To paraphrase a friend - You know how  phone  is spelled? It starts with an  F. 
Refurbished ripoff. Says new and is not. The screen cover to peel off is for an iphone  missing the phone key for the sim slot. Came out of box dusty. Not unlocked. Complete scam and now I have to wait to get my money back.
It came with open box ..im compeletly disappointed ...it seems to be refurbisehed so i had to return it . Besides i checked it out and it appears to be refurbished
After owning this phone for 2 months I m back being a Samsung fan. My last was the S4 and the 2014 note 10.4  I felt abandoned when Samsung didn t update. Just updated to Android 11 and I commend Samsung for keeping their word on supporting this phone.Battery life is good with heavy usage over 24 to 36 hour period. Usually have 15% when I plug in the charger. The finger print reader has a quick response if you find the EXACT spot on the screen. Screen is rich with color and response  but you ll need to adjust sensitivity if you use a screen protector. The phone has to many features to go over here  I will say that I m only about 40% into discovery of moderate research of all the settings. If you have a smart things hub you ll love the user experience with the app. My Galaxy Buds+ and Active 2 watch also have a great interface and user experience.
Just recently purchase the Galaxy S20 FE 5G (1-2021) what a great phone  smart with many features and compact enough to keep in your pocket ( I had bought the Ultra model and it was to bulky to keep in your pocket) the battery life is great and it charges quickly with the charger that comes with the phone ( I read the S21 doesn t have a charger with the package) the camera is great  I m a hobby photographer and use Olympus mirrorless camera and this phone comes very close to the same quality pics  another good feature is that is made in South Korea  some parts maybe made in China  but I want to stop buying Chinese products when I have a choice. The phone is beautiful well designed  is a small computer it connects to my PC and when I m working I can receive and send messages from the PC.  never mind the iPhone  this Samsung is great  if you have a choice buy it you will not regret it.
I just want to say the battery life is pretty bad for the size of the battery and it seemed like I didn t get a brand new phone. My package came with no plastic wrap around it. The box was closed with tape but very loosely. As well as there being dust inside the box when opening it. Kind of suspect in my opinion. But only time will tell I guess.
Should have believed the other reviewers who hated the overly sensitive touch screen. Even with the  block accidental touches  option turned on  it is twitchy and very unpleasant.The phone does stream phone calls and music to my hearing aid via Bluetooth  which was what I bought it for  so I m going to keep it - but I hate it and may store it in a foam-rubber-lined steel box to keep it from unlocking and starting some unwanted app.The typical Samsung bloatware is present and can t be deleted or disabled by someone as un-tech-savvy as me. Same for the google pestware. But I knew that from the git-go so can t complain.Still  listening to music is a blessing! My hearing is such that even with a great stereo and speakers  it sounds like shit. But played by the phone through Bluetooth to my hearing aid it sounds pretty good - and that s the best I ll ever get.
I got this phone about a week ago and it s been frustrating to say the least. The fingerprint sensor is very hit or miss  mostly miss. I ve already had to reprogram my fingerprints. The touchscreen doesn t always register. The program is full of bloatware. So much space is used by proprietary garbage apps that you can t delete. When I swipe down the alerts at the top there are advertisements! There aren t many settings on the keyboard. This whole interface is just annoying. I came from the Pixel 2 which was very easy to use  no bloatware. Just free and empty  lots of settings. I should have gone w/my gut and bought the Pixel 5.
I bought this phone the first time  it was not compatible with ATT s 5G. I called ATT and Samsung to confirm that it was not related to settings or IMEI registration. I thought the phone was defective and exchanged for another one. The second phone was not compatible with ATT 5G either. I only get LTE+  which is the faster version of 4G  but not 5G. However  it could be because ATT does not have a real 5G network yet.The phone is fine  although I am quite disappointed that it is not compatible with ATT 5G  which was one of the reasons why I decided to buy this phone.
This phone is solid. It s interesting that in 2020  a  budget  phone is 700 dollars but it is definitely a great value for the money. The cameras aren t as great as the regular S20 line up but they are a solid upgrade coming from the S8. Just make sure you have great lighting if you plan to use the ultra wide lens or telephoto because photos get very grainy in less than ideal conditions. Battery life is solid. I work all week and when I m not on my phone a lot  I easily get 2 days and squeeze in a few hours from the next day if I really can t get to another charger. If I have a day off and I m on the phone for hours  I can easily make it to the end of the day at 20+ percent.The screen is great. Colors are bright and the quality 120 Hz refresh rate screen is buttery smooth to navigate. The phone is definitely bigger and closer to the Note 20 (non Ultra model) in terms of size so that takes some getting used to. Touch could be a bit better. Sometimes you have to touch the screen more than once to activate the screen or to select something. The fingerprint reader is an optical one so it s hit or miss sometimes. I have found that if I pay attention to where I place my finger  it tends to recognize it more easily. I just never thought I d miss the one on the S8 considering the poor placement of the thing. The stereo speakers can get nice and loud and are better than the single firing ones found on my old phone. Reviewers say that the sound is not as rich as the more premium version of this phone bit if you re coming from a phone that is over 2 years old with only a single speaker  you  enjoy them.. Definitely get a phone cover because the plastic back does scratch and dent easily if you drop it on asphalt as I m finding out. Haptics are another area where Samsung cut back on this model. The vibration feels close to that of the S7 in a rickety sort of way. To their credit  they have calibrated the vibration motor to react more like when you are moving the cursor around on a text box like that found in a pixel. Just don t expect a solid thump like on the note 10 plus or the S20s. 6 Gb of ram is plenty now but I may wish I had gotten a phone with 8+ GB in a few years after some OS updates. Only time will tell. Its a crazy time and hard to believe that phone prices have inflated the way they have but if you can get the phone on sale  it s a no brainer and very easy to recommend.
I ve by chance had a total of three of these in my family  so have a decent handle on them. For the specs on paper  it seems a good deal. But it s a problematic phone.Firstly  build quality is inconsistent. One was perfect  and two have gaps and overhangs of the back plastic onto the phone. Second is battery life...for such a large battery  it doesn t feel like it lasts as long as it should.Most importantly...touch screen issues. Just Google it. All of ours have it  and it will drive you nuts. The updates were supposed to help  and did to some extent  but the problem still persists and makes pinch zooming so annoying. I wouldn t bother with this phone unless its heavily discounted.
phone is discounted for price and quality.I have this phone almost for two months now  having a lot of issues on the screen.Never had fingerprint reading issues including old versions of galaxy phones. Screen is garbage.if you use drawing app you will see screen misses lots of touching points when you are drawing something. Also it registers lines which you didn t make.Also unlocking with fingerprint is a nightmare. 70% of the time it doesn t recognize my fingerprint and I have to type my password after five failed entries.Camera is taking the worst photos with not so great coloring and kind of blurry images.Especially with the front camera I was never able to take good picture quality since it is fixed focus.This is the worst phone I have ever has as Samsung.so unhappy with it. and returning it.Not recommended at all!
First off  love this phone. Works great for all my needs  and other reviews cover that well.Now the important thing for me- 3 weeks after putting this phone in service  I left it on the roof of my car. After retracing my drive home  I found it in the middle of a 4 lane road by constantly calling it as we drove along the shoulder of the road. Obviously it had been ran over multiple times during the hour and a half it sat there  but the ringing led us straight to it. The only damage was a shattered Supershieldz screen protector and scuffed Otterbox Defender case- the phone is still in perfect condition. True testament to this phones durability  including the gurrilla glass- I still can t believe I m typing this review on the same phone that was run over multiple times and still laying in the middle of a lane a few short hours ago.Way to Samsung- you have a customer for life!
i had the following questions:1. would it really be new out of the box?2. would it be functional given the mid price range ?3. would changing sim/switching from old phone work well?The answers:1. It was brand new in every way down to the box with factory seal. Flawless condition2. Now keep in mind i switched from a much older galaxy S6. I dont care too much re the camera. With these in mind  the phone works great and delivers all the performance you would expect.The ONE MAJOR thing to keep in mind: Even next to the old S6 (higher screen resolution)  the screen looks a little shabby when set at the same brightness. The contrast of dark letters is not so crisp/sharp as a higher resolution screen. i adjusted to this by increasing the brightness. But that means much less battery life.3. Changing Sim/converting the phone was very easy and 5G network registered immediatelyConclusion: You have to be ok with a less sharp  less bright screen  and mid range camera. You can overcome the screen a little by increasing brightness but then battery life is less.If you are ok with these trade offs  this is a great phone and delivered brand new just as advertised.
I ve had this phone for quite a while now  and am absolutely loving it. I ve been noticing amazing battery life (16 hour days of moderate optimized usage)  games amazingly (runs Genshin Impact losing about 9-14% per hour)  absolutely NO stuttering  and the camera is pretty good too.Things this phone doesnt do as well as the note 20 ultra.Multitasking. If you want to have more than 3 apps open in the background and resuming where you left off  you wont get that here.Camera. There is 30x  but no 100x  zoom (not a big deal for me  but that might matter for you) And it probably isn t QUITE up to par with the pictures in the end.No pen. The s-pen can be very useful  but you wont get it here.There are a few other small things  but this is all the big things I ve noticed.CASE SUPPORT CASE SUPPORT CASE SUPPORT!!!!THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO CASE SUPPORT!!!!!If none of these things are deal breakers  GO BUY THIS PHONE! ITS AMAZING!
This is mostly a great phone but there are a few things I need to complain about.Pros:-Battery life seems great  I can go a couple days without charging and I use apps on it fairly often.- The photo quality is incredible! Maybe I m late to the game  but wow. The difference between my old phone and this one are massive.- Good size  fits in my pockets (even most of my tiny girl jean pockets. Ladies  you know what I mean. Stupid small pockets.Cons:- the vibrate is terribly weak. I always keep my phone on vibrate but I can t with this phone. I can t feel or hear the vibration in my pocket or even when it s sitting on my desk right beside me. It s so bad.- the flashlight... my old phone would turn the flashlight on when you shook the phone a certain way. This one does not. I have to unlock the phone and manually turn on the flashlight. Kind of a pain.Pro or con? The fingerprint sensor. At first  no matter what I did  it would not read my right thumb. At all. I had to remove it and redo it at least 3 times before it finally registered correctly. Now all my prints work just fine. You are only allowed 3 prints though and I would have loved 4. Oh well.Overall  I m enjoying my new phone but there are several aspects that I miss from my old phone (like customizable keyboards).
I really love this phone! I just switched from an iPhone 6s to this by switching out my sim card no problem. You should know that it doesn t come with a cable that will connect an iPhone with this phone  so purchase that beforehand if you want to switch over all of your settings  apps  etc... but you can get them transferred over via icloud.The camera is miles better than my old one  but the selfie  front facing camera is awful. It makes you look like marzipan  like its perpetually stuck on beauty mode. Its frustrating  but I m not a selfie queen anyway  so I m not too upset about it. But upset enough to give it 4 stars.This was the first phone I ordered from Amazon and I m pretty pleased!
The screen on this phone will randomly stop accepting touch inputs and then at other points it will click when trying to scroll or scroll up when lifting your finger. Looking at online forums  this seems to be a common problem with this particular phone from Samsung. Seems like they tried to cut some corners to get the price down while still advertising the 120hz display and it didn t work out well. Not sure if it s something that can be fixed with a software update but it wasn t corrected as of the October 2020 OTA update. Not going to chance waiting around for a fix and being outside the return window. If you are experiencing odd behavior with your screen and touch sensitivity  you re not alone. Bummer as well because otherwise I loved the phone.
To give some context  I m coming from a Galaxy S7.FYI  I read some of the bad reviews. Most are widely inaccurate.Pros- Easy setup: I m on Verizon and all I had to do was swap the sim card. I didn t have to take the phone to store  I didn t have to log in and change settings  etc.- The 120hz OLED screen is game changing (for me). I m gamer and I could immediately notice how fast and responsive the panel is. Colors are vibrant and blacks are inky inky black.- Processor is light years ahead of S7. It s also running the 20 series flagship processor.- Camera is amazing. 3x zoom and wide lens. Yesss please.- I love the colors. I got the Orange.- Samsung s OneUI is a huge improvement. Very intuitive and very powerful. I ve been setting up advanced Bixby routines. I honestly never thought i would use Bixby but I m a believer now.- Larger screen and battery than the S20- Very fast and responsive finger print scanner- Dual sim cards and up to 1TB of additional storage if you buy a micro sd card. I m looking at you APPLE. Although Samsung will be removing the sd card storage slot for S21 s for some reason.- Comes with a charger. APPLE!Cons- Face recognition is too slow for my liking. The finger print reader is more than adequate.- No 3mm headphone jack- Out of the box charger is not the best. You get a 15 watt charger even though this phone can handle 25 watts.In summary  if you can get this phone for 550 to 600 bucks... BUY IT.
I sold my s20 ultra and bought this. No issues so far everything works great. I now have extra money to buy something else.
Now that the price on this phone has gone down to $600  it is a very good deal for the price.The Snapdragon 865 processor is more than fast enough for anything I want to do. 6GB of memory is less than some other phones in this price range  but it is still more than enough for most people.The phone feels very solid despite the plastic back. If you use any kind of case  you won t even notice the plastic back.The phone supports 25W fast charging  but for some reason they only included a 15W charger in the box. Buying the 25W charger separately is a waste of money as well as a waste of the natural resources that were used on the 15W charger. Amazon sells decent 25W fast chargers for less than $15  so cheaping out on the charger is a real lame move by Samsung. You can search Amazon for 15W chargers that support  USB-C PPS  mode and are UL Certified.The screen looks beautiful when you turn on the 120Hz mode. This does burn your battery more quickly  but the battery is big enough that it still lasts all day.The screen has been very responsive to me. I have read bug reports about screen glitches for some people. Samsung has already released bug fixes that hopefully have fixed this. I advise only buying this phone from an authorized dealer with no hassle returns so you don t have to worry about this bug.The phone does have a lot of Samsung bloatware. I owned a Samsung S-series phone several years ago and the bloatware was really bad then. This one is much better. You don t even need to create a Samsung account to use the phone now. Most of the Samsung bloatware (other than the camera app) won t work if you don t have a Samsung account  but if you never use it  this isn t a problem. There are several tutorials online about disabling all the bloatware if you never want to see any of it on your screen.The triple camera setup on this phone is very good for this price level. The telephone camera works great up to 3X in good light. Image quality deteriorates quickly if you zoom in past 3X or in lower lighting conditions. Telephoto cameras are getting rare in this smartphone price range  so I m glad this phone has one. I really like using the telephoto lens for landscape and nature photography. The normal and wide angle cameras work better in lower light situations (including indoor situations)  though not as good as the iphone or Google Pixel phones. Pictures do tend look more processed than with some other phone cameras. Some people like the Samsung look. Other people prefer more natural looking photos. You should try to look at sample photos before buying the phone  since you cannot completely disable the Samsung photo processing.This phone comes with Android version 10 out of the box  which is one version behind the Android version 11 that the Google Pixel phones are shipping with. Samsung promises software support with 3 version updates  but that is a little misleading since 1 of those version updates will be just to catch up with the current Android version 11. Still  3 years of bug fixes and security patches is better than what Samsung used to offer.
Found out my phone also has the touch screen issue others are complaining about. Tested it with Touch Screen Test app  instruction is on Youtube. Two finger swipe causes criss-cross pattern. Jittery and unresponsive swipe action when scrolling through websites. If software issue it can eventually be fixed  but not going to wait around to find out that it s a hardware issue. Returning the phone after one hour of use. Guess Samsung cut a critical corner while trying to reduce the cost of the FE version.
I ve been a OnePlus fan for years. I ve owned a OnePlus 3  6  and (currently) a 7t. They ve always been solid phones at a solid price  undercutting the bigger players with nearly-flagship specs at mid-range prices.So why did I even consider the Samsung S20 FE if I m so happy with the 7t?Well  I have to confess. I m getting a $500 TMobile trade-in value on an old Google 3a I had laying around. $199 net for a brand new Samsung S series phone? Well that was too enticing not to consider.Then there s this. I wanted a true wide-angle lens and better optical zoom. For as much as I love my 7t  I ve been longing for something with a little more versatility and quality in the camera stack. (Yeah  I take a lot of pictures.) The 7t s wide-angel lens isn t all that wide and the telephoto is about 1.7x  not 2x or even 3x.So if I wanted a better camera setup  why not go for one of the other S series with higher res sensors and longer zooms? Because the rest of the S20 line was out of my price range. I wanted better cameras  but I m not insane. $1300 for the S20 Ultra and it s 4x zoom? No way. $1400 for the Note 20 Ultra with it s 5x zoom? Nuts.$699 (with MAJOR trade-in incentives) for a Samsung S20 FE with specs to rival the OnePlus 8?Now *that* was worth a look.I m glad I looked. This may be the first time I walk away from OnePlus and land on Samsung. The jury is still out  and this is still an early review (I ve only had the phone for a couple of days)  but so far I m duly impressed.Now I won t belabor pixel peeping comparisons between the various phones. Pop over to Youtube and you can find comparisons between just about every phone on the market. What I will say is simply this. For $699 the Samsung S20 FE compares extremely favorably to the OnePlus 8  not to mention the rest of the phones in the Samsung S series.So what follows is a quick rundown of the good  the bad  and the meh. I don t think there s really anything  ugly   just a little  meh. The Good...* I ve never been a fan of the Samsung  Edge  style screen. I always turn it off. The S20 FE has a nice  flat  vibrant screen. You get Samsung screen brilliance in a no edgy gimmicks  6.5  form factor. Nearly bezel-less. Oh yeah  and it does 120hz  but for battery life purposes I ve dialed mine back to 60hz. I m not a big gamer and frankly 60hz works for me.* The performance is perfectly acceptable. I ve seen benchmarks that indicate Samsung isn t squeezing every ounce of power out of the Qualcomm 865  but I don t have any complaints. I can load up everything I typically run and never encounter a slow-down. (Browser  password manager  camera  news feeds  social media  etc.)* The battery life has been good so far  and I expect it to get a little better after it breaks in and Android does it s app tuning magic. I just finished my second day with about 30% left in the tank after a typical usage cycle; a TON of web browsing  a couple of Youtube videos  some social media  LOTS of messaging  a couple of calls.* The cameras are surprisingly solid for a phone at this price point. The 12mp wide angle sensor is poppy and vibrant with TONS of detail. It s a bona-fide wide-angle  too  unlike my OnePlus 7t that trims a few mm off the angle. The 12mp main sensor is well matched to the wide angle  producing nearly identical exposures and saturation  with plenty of detail. Sure  everyone s crazy about megapixels  but 12m is plenty for most applications and I ve printed 12mp shots up to 20x30 in the past with good success. Now  the 8mp 3x optical telephoto is worth a special note. Yes  8mp is a tad skimpy  but when you consider that other phones in the Galaxy S range (and other manufacturers) use a combination of pixel binning and AI magic to artificially create longer zooms  8mp 3x optical is... well  it s workable. So far the results are not only usable  but quite good. At 10x the results are still usable  though I wouldn t use them for blow-ups. At 20x  detail is dropping off fast  far earlier than the  space  zoom on the higher end Galaxy S20 line with their higher resolution sensors. By 30x the photos are unusable for anything but... well  they re unusable. At this price point  though  the quality is quite good and I have no complaints. I m paying half the cost versus the other Samsungs with more advanced zoom setups  so I m getting about what I expect at this price. Oh yeah... I don t do selfies. YMMV ;) BTW... The camera software launches *faster* than the module on the Note 20 Ultra. No kidding. The bargain unit is faster than the flagship. Noticeably. Like a second or two faster. Go figure.* Memory Card slot. Why can t Apple give you expandable memory? No memory expansion on the OnePlus. Why couldn t Samsung add it to the $799 Note 20? The S20 FE has it at $699. Winning!* Oh yeah  and one bennie... I know a lot of people go bluetooth and live audio isn t as big a deal anymore. I happen to be one of those folks who likes to listen to live audio off my phone. I carry it around with me. The OnePlus 7t has always been a bit tinny for my taste  another minor annoyance. The audio on the S20 FE is actually passably rich and full.  Passably.  This is no Bose Soundbar. It s just not annoying. ;)The Bad* Slower charging than the OnePlus 8. Come on  Samsung. You can do better than 25w charging. How can tiny little OnePlus keep beating you to the technology punch on charging?* Plastic back. Some people don t like this. I m fine with it. I put my phones in Spigen slim cases anyway. But if you re spoiled by all-glass backs  this isn t going to win you over.* Samsung One UI. Bloatware. Irrelevant. Childish looking. Replace it with Nova Launcher  tune it to your taste  and move on. OnePlus has a clean  crisp UI and that s the way it should be. Samsung needs to grow up and get rid of One UI.* 6gig of RAM? Come on  Samsung. OnePlus routinely puts 12gig in. Now I don t need 12gig  and I ve never pushed my phone to those limits  but please  it s time to grow up and beef up the RAM  even at this price point.The Meh* 5G performance is good when you can find it  but it crushes battery life. I never run it on anything but 4G. I don t need 5G. I m not streaming 8k to my phone. I m just using it for the typical stuff people use a smartphone for.* Please  for the love of the UNIVERSE  kill BIXBY! Bixby  Bixby  Bixby! KILL BIXBY! In the age of the Google Assistant and Alexa  it s utterly  completely useless. Why tie Bixby to a button? KILL IT! UGH!* Who puts volume buttons on the right? Seriously. If you want to create a phone for righties  the volume buttons should fall under the index finger  not the thumb. The power button goes under the thumb  as it is on this phone. This is a bizarre design choice and OnePlus gets it right. Samsung  not so much.* One thing OnePlus continues to add to their phones that nobody else on the Android side has added is a volume mute slider. I can t tell you the number of times that silly little slider has come in handy during meetings. Flip a switch. No need to open the screen. Just slide the switch. Steal the idea  Samsung. (Correction  just take inspiration from it. :) )Bottom line...This phone is a GREAT value for the price. At this price point it s in the same league as the OnePlus 8 and in some subtle ways it s a notch better. The only reason anyone would spend any more money than this would be to get gimmicks and pointless performance bumps. Save your money. Make it a Galaxy S20 FE or a OnePlus 8.
I ordered this phone when Amazon said 8gb of ram... Showed up with 6gb  and now the site has been corrected. Good phone though! The front-facing camera has a little silver ring around it that makes it super noticable  and the phone seems to get pretty hot due to the plastic back  but otherwise I m pretty impressed with this thing.
I ordered this phone and had high hopes that it would be what I had hoped for. This phone s screen on numerous occasions has stopped working or would randomly open apps when trying to scroll. This phone is very disappointing.
Just ordered my phone it came super quick at a discount from Amazon. For $635   the phone is quick the cameras look really cool on the back but I m not a fan of how clear they look the picture is fuzzy and is always halfway zoomed in. Coming from lg Google phone from 2017 the samsung ui and ecosystem is mediocre at best  it feels really slippery and unfufilling like every app you open is opened on accident like you just slipped into this app. Counter intuitive power off process(its not the same as to power on wtf ). Bixby sucks to say the least  a lot of wireless half baked features that are impractical. But the phone seems reliable enough  I know how to maximize battery life like first changing the wallpaper to a black and white version  limiting 5g/network(I like how you can easily enable 5g if needed  but who really needs that much power?)  and of course keeping no apps running in the background  and putting the phone on do not disturb mode so it doesn t vibrate itself to oblivion  which is weird because the phone forces a lot of notifications even after you turn them off or minimize them. I expected a little cleaner software  honestly would have preferred a brand new s9+  but I couldn t find anything that wasn t refurbished. I turned the 120 Hz refresh rate off and boom the battery is lasting a couple days on the regular love 4500 MA battery. I like the glasstic back  but be warned there is a slippery feel to it so go to eBay and grab a quick 10 buck case to be safe. Overall I m happy with the device. The expandable storage is very nice and I bought another 128 gigs for 30 bucks at target so I have all the memory I need and more! Just wish I could switch to the Google version of software but keep the Samsung hardware  because those pixels are looking weak! Watching the iphone 12 commercial made me shrug and grateful I had this phone  the price  the value  and the vibe of my mint cloud samsung 20 fe is one that is pretty much unmatched! The box is the phone and charger  the speakers sound is a little above average. The fingerprint reader is solid and practical. Totally worth it.
Just received the S20 FE today. Im switching over from the original Pixel XL. Wasnt thrilled enough with the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G lineup/availability. So I thought I would give this one a shot. Overall its been a good first day with the phone.I popped in my Verizon sim card and after setup (see below) I immediately had cell service and 4G connectivity. No problems there.Setup was kinda a pain switching from a Google phone. I had my old phone backing up to Google drive. The setup process didnt quite help make a full transfer. It pulled in my contacts and app data  but didnt reinstall my play store apps automatically or transfer my SMS/call history. What I ended up doing was using the Samsung Smart Switch app. I installed it on my old/new device and it transferred every thing. Contacts  SMS/call history  app data  photos  videos  etc. It even started automatically installing my missing apps. That was nice.Performance wise the phone feels pretty snappy and has a nice display. I havent had a chance to play with the camera yet. Today was just  get the phone up and running  day.My biggest issue is not with the phone itself but with the the original listing on Amazon when I purchased the phone a few days back. It said the phone had 8GB of RAM. That was a selling point for me. When I booted up the phone I check the settings and it says 6GB. I came back into this phones listing in Amazon and wouldnt you know  now it says the phone has 6GB of RAM. Hmmm... That kinda ticked me off. But not the phones fault.
Bought one from best buy with hardware version 1.0 and an another with hardware version 1.1. Bought a 3rd one from amazon and I have to save all three units have the same issue.Pros-Battery life-Snapdragon 865-Size-WeightCons- Touch screen issues. Even after three firmware updates  samsung can t seem to fix the problem.- Black crush issue. This is visible on all 3 of my units. Ended up returning all 3.- Android auto and bluetooth constantly disconnect. Tried samsung  oneplus  xiaomi  and lg cables and all seem to disconnect. I never had android auto or bluetooth disconnect on my older android devices.
**UPDATE 10/18/21**If you re thinking about the S21  stick with this phone. After a year of owning the S20FE  this phone is still great and performs perfect. I still love it.Last time I owned a Samsung phone was back in the TouchWiz days of the note 2. Since then for me it s been motorola and Google  but I decided to give Samsung a try again. I am so glad I went with this phone over the Pixel 5. At the time  the s20 FE was $100 cheaper than the pixel 5 and the reviews across youtube sold me on this phone. Having owned the G7 power and G power  having the extra battery life is important to me. At first I tried the A71 5G but it felt incomplete. I was not impressed with the build quality or the cameras  even the battery did not last despite being the same capacity as the s20 fe. I am so glad I returned the A71 5G and got this one just a few weeks later. I was not planning for samsung to announce this phone at all. Easily worth the extra $100. It feels more premium  and I prefer the matte finish on the S20 FE compared to the A71. The cloud white is so nice and universal  with hints of aura glow depending on the lighting. It has the finish to that of a CD. But as far as battery  out of the box with 48 percent I ve been using the phone nonstop for a little over 2 hours now and I m down to 27. That s pretty impressive considering the battery isn t fully calibrated. The One UI is great  the 120hz screen is super smooth and responsive and that SD 865 performance is very nice as well. The phone can keep up with me easily. Despite the lack of the headphone jack  I think the pros outweigh the cons. The screen  the build quality  the battery and the audio quality is very nice. 5G connectivity is fast with T-Mobile and the fact this phone supports wifi 6 capability  this phone is definitely future proof. This may be the start of something Samsung can move forward with. A premium device with flagship specs for less. I will definitely update the review as I have more time with the phone and upload some sample photos but as it is now  a solid 5 stars from me. You can t go wrong for $599.99. Flagship specs for a cheaper price  Samsung definitely got it right with the S20 FE. I can totally recommend. I ll definitely be sticking with this phone for a while  especially considering Samsung promised this phone 3 years of updates.*Update 1/21/2021*I ve had the phone for a few months now and I just still love it as much as the first day I got it  the new One UI 3  android 11 update is definitely welcomed  the camera is still taking phenomenal pictures  and the battery is still holding up. I was contemplating trading it in for the S21  but I think this phone is much better for what you get at the price it s offered.
I just got the S20FE today and it looks pretty good so far  but the description on Amazon is pretty inaccurate.This does NOT have 8gb RAM  only 6gb. This has been updated in the description now  but not when I bought it. Additionally  it does NOT come with the AKG headset which the description still says should be included. So if you don t have Bluetooth headphones  you re out of luck  or will still need to go buy a pair.Customer service also did not help  the only solution is to return for a refund. I still need the phone so that s not a solution. All I wanted was for all the parts in the description to come.
Don t buy it if you want a dual sim phone!!I bought it on Amazon since I saw it supports dual sim in customer questions. Turns out it doesn t work and wastes a whole day of mine to figure it out. Maybe the esim will work but I don t want to spend more time on this.It s a good product  but Amazon makes it hard to enjoy it.
What nobody anywhere is talking about and I wonder whyI wonder if I am more sensitive to this as I upgraded from a quite old Note 4 that I had rooted and was running mostly aftermarket apps on. But when I  upgraded  to this phone I was blown away by the staggering amount of bloatware and intrusive apps pre installed on this phone. The BIGGEST by far being Samsungs own software  it is everywhere! It has it s hands in everything and if you take the time to look through at all the permissions on this software it is staggering how much information about you it is allowed to collect.Now we all know that having a smartphone means some loss of privacy and that companies use the selling of certain information to offset the cost of the devices they are selling you. I understand that. But  again....maybe it s just me but I am not OK with the level at which they force this down your throat and the amount of preinstalled and (can not be removed or actually stopped) apps that have full permissions to ALL of your information.Yes it s a good phone  it should have a bit more ram for what it is  I like the SD card expansion slot ( I can t believe that has to be said) Snappy processor and camera is OK at best. I really expected more from what should have been Samsungs near flagship device for the time. Price seems to be going up again for some reason as well. When I bought mine in Febuary of 2021 it was 599 from Amazon themselves.
Nothing  Budget  about the price on this phone and yet they still found a way to justify REMOVING high use features that have been available to their  faithful  users for YEARS on previous models. This will not be my last phone but it will be my LAST SAMSUNG!If you like to associate different ringtones to individual phone numbers like  Freebird  to the ex s number   Show me the Money  to your Accountant  and some Barry White to the new significant other then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!If you like to use a voicemail app that stores your phone messages on your phone so that you can in two swipes see and delete message and don t have to hit four buttons to call out to a 8** number just to hear/delete/save a message then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!If you prefer to  one swipe/delete  text messages from the Messaging App and do not want to be FORCED to use yet FOUR more screen touches to open the text/menu/delete/trash buttons just to delete a text message then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!If you want to feel 100% assured that your are the first owner of this phone and the phone nor the packaging has been fiddled with where you have the  Navy  version that the Manufacturer associated with the serial number on the phone instead of a  Mint  cover to match the designation on a box label then DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!However If you love touching your phone with extra unnecessary sub-menus then GET THIS PHONE!If you like your phone FULL of Google and Samsung Apps that you CANNOT remove OR Disable and that will constantly be up your  er in your face on a phone that you will pay high dollar for then GET THIS PHONE!If you want to save $100.00 from the Carriers for this model and save the extra $200.00 it would take to get a phone with real features then GET THIS PHONE!I  Used  to look forward to using my phone and hearing the different tones associated with friends and family. Thanks Samsung/Sprint for providing a substandard product with the release of the S20 FE 5G.
Cheap plastic backing  HORRIBLE 407 ppi  UGLY reds  poor screen quality overall  no headphone jack  downgraded power supply (used to be glossy with nice  visible grey lettering)  no headphones included  sluggish fingerprint reader  and genuinely the most DISGUSTINGLY cheap Samsung galaxy S series phone I ve ever had! Even my S6 is more premium! This is what happens when you let influencers glow about everything  without calling the downgrades out! I ve never been so disappointed in a product. What a nasty joke of a Samsung S series. This is NOT a quality phone in any aspect that counts. I hate it. I do not reccomend buying this. Coming from the S9  this is a MAJOR downgrade and I m furious about it.
If you play mobile games that require a lot of tapping and swiping from both fingers  stay away from this phone. The phone registers ghost taps during rapid finger movements between two fingers which creates a dragging effect. It s very noticeable in first person shooter games where your character will suddenly look at a different  unintended direction.It remains to be seen if this can be solved via software updates. Samsung already tried (i have the latest patch) and the problem still persists. If they can t patch it within my return period  it s going back.Other than that  yes you get flagship specs at a midrange phone price.
the phone I PURCHSED is not compatible with GLOBAL SYSTEM NETWORK
I had my previous phone  a Huawei Mate 9 for 3 years (ordered from Amazon)  and I felt it was time for an upgrade. After researching and narrowing my decision down to the Google Pixel 5 and the Samsung S20 FE 5G  I chose the S20 FE 5G. For me  it came down to being able to expand the memory and I prefer to have that option. So far  everything works great. I love the pastel color choices! Cloud lavender looks pretty and so does the Cloud Orange  but I had to go with my favorite color  Cloud Mint.The fingerprint reader is accurate and fast. When unlocking the phone  the bright light is a little blinding  especially if unlocking the phone in the dark. Face recognition works great and it unlocks well with my eyeglasses on too.For the battery life  it seems that it doesn t last long compared to my previous phone. With the S20 FE 5G  I noticed with my normal use (watching YouTube videos  using social media  surfing the internet  etc.)  I would have to charge it after a day  but with the Mate 9  I was able to use it for almost 2 days before having to charge it.I love the quality of the rear/front camera. The rear camera focuses well and the photos appear brighter/sharper which I like. The front camera is fixed and doesn t allow for autofocus when tapping on the screen  which I m bummed out about. I hope this is something that will be fixed. The super steady mode is awesome!Included in the box: phone  charging adapter  charging cable  paperwork  and the sim tray eject tool. I do wish the charging cable was a bit longer and I wish it came with earphones  but it s not a big deal. I ll be buying a usb-c to 3.5mm headphone adapter. I do have Bluetooth earbuds  but I prefer connecting directly for better sound.When I received my package and I opened it up  it came with ZERO packaging  which I was unhappy about. You would think it would come with some protection with bubble wrap or air pillows to avoid the phone from getting tossed around in the box. Amazon  please make sure the package is secured well so the product we are paying $$$ for arrives safely.
Coming from a pixel 2 I expected more.Front camera is slow and very blurry in low-lightvibration intensity is pathetic  I keep missing calls.it s obnoxiously largefingerprint scanner is inconsistent at best  even without any screen protection (if anyone had one in stock)Samsung s version of android is garbage  I actually downgraded from Android 11 to 10battery life is better than my ancient phone.wifi6 is fast  about 300Mbps testedWifi6 Stats:Channel 40 (11ax)Signal 94% (-53 dBm)Rx Rate 960 MbpsTx Rate 648 MbpsPower Save Enabled5G is decent (LTE+ indicated at 100Mbps down  4Mbps up  AT&T in Raleigh  NC)If you you like Samsung s spin on android and large screens this is a great phone for you.

I decided on the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for my smartphone upgrade for a lot of reasons. One  and most obviously  was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it)  it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so  I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance  the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen  while not 4K  still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good  nice and crisp. I ve done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography  all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid  but not the best in the market right now. You ll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also  you can t beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support)  you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size  while much larger than I was used to  still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though  as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But  if you ve been reading up on the S20 FE at all  then you know that there are problems. First off  the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself  I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls  that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I d say it works about 85% of the time  but when it doesn t  do you ever feel it. Adding on  the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad  but it s not flagship levels by any stretch. You ll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you re looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with  I d look elsewhere.From what I ve seen  the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes  my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There s undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released  but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no  at least for me. While I m sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers)  I really haven t noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter  but that s about all I ve seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE  I don t blame you.It really is a shame that I can t give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars  because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues  there s always the worry that time will make them worse. It s a genuine worry  I get that. But even with the problems  the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone  but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse  but for right now  I m more than happy with it.Edit (8/18/2021): I ve dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It s been a little less than a year  and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay  maybe not daily use  per se. But enough that it s starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket  it s opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen  as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here s the cold  honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone s screen. It s beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic  angry Amazon customer 1-star  review  but I ll refrain. There s still good here with the chip  customizability  and great battery life  but that stuff can only get you so far.Here s my advice: don t bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price  with better specs. It s still not the worst thing out there and I m not tossing it in the trash just yet  but it s definitely the last Samsung product I ll be buying. So disappointing  but I couldn t keep this review a 4-star in good conscience.
When I purchased this it was listed as 8gb of ram but the model I received is 6gb. That makes me feel lured into something I wasn t expecting.The phone is a solid overall phone with premium performance for the price due to sacrificing the build quality by making the back plastic and the screen gorilla glass 3 instead of 6.Doesn t matter to me as I wanted an unused device (battery) with a top notch processor for the smallest price point.I m still slightly upset about not getting 8gb as was listed when I purchased which is why I didn t rate 5/5.
Never again will I buy another Samsung phone. My Galaxy S8+ is superior in every way except 5G. This phone reeks internal design contest by 1st year interns. Goodbye Samsung.
The media could not be loaded.  This was the perfect phone until I started wondering what was wrong with my screen. Your touchs will be misread causing random inputs and jitter. This is a recording of how the phone is recognizing my inputs when using two fingers in alternating succession as well as when swiping with two fingers. This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games  the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8. The most recent software update to fix the issue has made no difference. If you buy this phone it WILL have this problem. I was originally in the group that assumed mine wasn t affected  but it became hard to ignore the signs after a week.
Just got this yesterday  the day it came out. I got the Navy Blue  which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel s battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates  I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a  but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen  huge battery  and top-of-the-line processor for $600  that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what s in the Pixel line  it s not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn t as good  and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost  but I feel that the Pixel software doesn t add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else  it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two.
When I pre-order the description was 8 GB Ram but I received with 6 GB. I checked the description back and found it have been changed from 8 GB to 6 GB. This is so weird.
This phone seemed like it had it all for an unbeatable price of $550. Big battery  120 hz  good cameras  recent cpu  and okay ram. Well all this stuff would have made this phone a keeper except the touch screen issues. This is literally how the user communicates with the phone and allows you to access all these great features. Really stinks that an issue this big slipped through. Samsung has released 3 software updates trying to fix it  but still have problems with jittery scrolling  accidental touches  etc. This isn t something that can be fixed with an update in my opinion or it would be resolved by now. Look elsewhere  or if your brave chance it I guess. I thought I would get lucky despite all the bad reviews/complaints (check samsung forums). I don t mean to be a downer but I strongly advise to choose a different phone. I m still looking myself. Good luck!
Took the phone to a Verizon store as soon as I received it and after 30 minutes of the rep trying to activate it he called Verizon tech support and was told the phone had no registered ESN and could not be activated on their network. The phone also appeared to have been used as it had scratches in the end and was missing the sim card key. Am returning the phone.
I like the phone itself. It s snappy and seems to work well (although the fingerprint reader is a little weak). My main complaint is the screen is far too brittle. I bought an s20 fe for both my wife and I and her screen has cracked once  been replaced  cracked again and mine has cracked as well. Both have been in cases with screen protectors and not been subject to abuse. Never had this problem with other phones. Sad because other wise is a good phone.
After a couple of weeks I really like this phone. It s fast and has a beautiful screen  big but not too big. My S7 died so I had to upgrade  this was a major upgrade for me. I will not buy a phone without an SD card slot so that eliminated the S21 and iPhone right off the bat. My pictures are on the SD card and a backup of my call logs and SMS messages so I didn t really lose anything  the rest was backed up to my Google account. I like that I can take photos and video in UHD at 21:9 aspect ratio so they fit my monitor. Not bad for the price  I hope it lasts 4 years like my S7 did. The S7 was the only one that ever died on me  I have my original Galaxy  an S3  S5  S7 (dead) and my Samsung flip phone still. Now the S20 FE and I can definitely recommend it.
This phone is supposed to be NEW!!! As you can see in the photos  when I opened the box it was dusty inside and you can t see but there s a fingerprint on the screen. Also  you can see a sim card was activated on March 8th and I received the phone on April 4th. Also  whomever had it before had 50 pages open on the internet. I do believe I need to be compensated for getting a USED phone when it was clearly advertised as NEW!!!! I m considering sending it back! PISSED OFF!!
The phone does work as a smart phone. When I can get it to take pictures in focus they are nice but it is hard to tell until after if I am not specifically looking at the focus.Auto focus:The auto focus is painfully slow. Sometimes it just works but most times it works after a solid 1-3 seconds. Sometimes it takes >5s which just leaves me wondering what it is doing that could take this long.A perfect example is with normal lens everything in view of the camera is >20  away and it is just stuck out of focus for 3 seconds. Then the focus finally starts to wander after another 1-2 seconds it focuses.This seems to affect both the normal and zoom lense. I don t use the wide angle much but I would guess it has the same problem.The final result of this is if I m in a hurry and not paying attention to the focus 1/4 to 1/3 of my pictures are out of focusFinger Print Sensor:It works okay most of the time. When in a dark environment it is blindingly bright if you don t cover the entire sensor before the back light turns on at ~100% brightness.Also sometimes the phone unlocks at 100% brightness too which just seems like sloppy programming that doesn t turn down the rest of the screen brightness before it displays it. It seems like it realizes it is dark after the phone has been unlocked for a 1/10 of a second.Overall it makes unlocking my phone in the dark painful at best. It feels like it is wrong more times than it is right so I close my eyes before I try unlocking it.Using the Camera kills other apps:I run and keep track of it on my phone. If I take some pictures while running more often than not the camera app will silently kill all apps running on the phone. So when I get done I find that my phone stopped recording when I took some pictures. There doesn t seem to be a way to stop the camera from killing everything. In testing I can get runs that are 39 seconds long by taking pictures shortly after starting the run.Note: Moved to this phone from the S9
Phone worked well for a couple hours. Then started getting message that wireless charging paused. Would wait for charger  Samsung model  to stop blinking red. Would try again. Maybe one time in four it would work. Took the case off and had the exact same behavior. Tried my old phone and it worked 100% of tries  so returned S20 FE 5G.
Why am I picking stars on features I do not care about.There is no way I am using Face recognition or a Fingerprint reader.I use the phone to call people and answer text messages.My reason for the feedback is that Amazon placed a $700 brand new phone in a box with one little air bubble wrap and the thing is bouncing around.A little common sense would be great.It s an expensive electronic device. This is exactly why I refuse to buy Hard drives from these people.I bought an 2 extremely expensive FPGA dev boards just to have 1 that I was required to sign for but the other one was where the Amazon box was placed inside a USPS box then sent through regular mail.GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER PEOPLE.There is no reason to connect your Alexa to a dish washer where you focus your energy yet you can t even send high end electronics through the mail without controversy.I have no doubt this review will make it through but hopefully someone will read it and say...hey...Maybe we should look at this.
I really love the phone so far! It is pretty nice. The feedback it gives when you type. It is great.The biggest biggest biggest issue is that the OS is bugged. You can not leverage hybrid SIM it just won t allow it.SIM 1 if occupied prevents SIM 2 from identifying its presence. If SIM 1 is unoccupied SIM 2 works. This is not how it is supposed to work. It is likely the phone needs a firmware fix.I hope Samsung can address this big Oops.
I ve been a Samsung fan and user for a long time and I looked forward to finally upgrading from the galaxy s8 active. I did tons of research and finally chose this galaxy s20fe and dropped the $600 to buy it with excitement.Now that I have it  I m sad to say that the camera - one of the single most important features of the phone for me - is broken and/or unusable. No trauma  no visible damage  but the lens rattles around if you shake the phone a bit and all of my pictures in the 1x to 3x zoom level come out like the one you see here.The camera has 3 lenses for different zoom levels and only the 1x - 3x zoom range is useless  but that s the most important one.I think Samsung needs to work on the 3 lens design some more as all of their multi-lens phone cameras seen to have problems.Anyway  I ll be attempting to trade this phone back to Samsung toward a galaxy s9 (shame to have to revert to older models for reliability) or some other single-lens camera or selling it as is and buying an iPhone. Haven t decided yet.
I have tried a lot for phones recently. Sony  pixel 5  and s21 ultra.Pixel 5 freezes randomly at times and Bluetooth issues  Sony was just not very good and drained battery life like crazy. I tried giving the Sony two chances because the camera features are nice but it wasn t enough enough to cover the flaws. The s21 ultra was fantastic  but I couldn t justify the price tag. This phone however was the best. 120hz screen makes it feel premium  but hardware is not slow to where to muddied the user experience. The screen is bright  and it s not 4k but you can t tell on a all device. The battery life also lasts so long because the resolution is not high. Samsung s interface is quite nice and it certainly makes using an android phone extremely enjoyable because it doesn t feel cheap like the Sony did. I will never use an iPhone again  and it was hard for me to find a great alternative. I was hesitant on getting a Samsung too because I was in love with Google products up until the pixel 5. However I can say I m a big fan of Samsung and their phones and will probably keep using their phones given the user experience was unrivaled by any other Android phone. I would highly recommend this phone
Like other reviewers have mentioned this thing has touch issues. I can be randomly scrolling on Reddit when the phone does something else randomly. I m started the return on this   hopefully Samsung can fix the problem for there. i bought this in nov  or dec 2020 and got my refund
Using a note 9  then got this s20FE for a work phone. So many features missing  can t deep press screen to wake up phone  there is no fingerprint scanner  face recognition doesn t work well. The camera is too low so when you install a screen protector its within a small circle that fills with dust very easily. The rear camera lense stick way out of the phone requiring you to buy a separate protector for the back. When a slim phone case is on its nearly flush with the rear lense/glass.There are a lot less options for cases  went with same brand of case and they didn t even give it a back stand either.This phone is one worth skipping over  definitely not worth more than $250...
The media could not be loaded.  Everything on the phone is fine  love the cameras on the back  except the front facing camera FOR SELFIES ONLY. When I switch to the front facing video  it has a better quality  and it sincerely doesn t make sense  seems like a software issue  but still  paying a lot for this phone and getting mediocre results in selfie pictures is very disappointing  and illogical.
ProsFast ChargingWireless ChargingNice zoom and camera colors for that back cameraLots of Ram for GamesSamsung DEXConsreally REALLY poor front facing cameraOnly allows i think 4 finger prints that often failThe charger it comes with doesn t seem to be Using the full charging potential
My previous phone - LG G8 Thinq - was flaking out on me  the battery not holding anything like a proper charge. I looked at several models/brands in a modest price range (that were also available) and since this was actually available and also since the faster CPUs seem to universally overheat (and I don t tend to play games) this seemed like a good phone to try. The cameras review well and I was able to get a belt clip for it too.The best part by far though are the speakers  far louder and clearer than my previous phone or in fact any previous phone I ve owned. I like to listen to YouTube while I walk my dog  don t really want headphones and this is a fantastic improvement.
This phone has been a solid upgrade for me  minus an issue with my service provider. After 4.5 hours in several stores  I was unable to get this unlocked phone to connect to the Sprint Network  and had to get my account transferred to T Mobile. Butt they re the same company now  aren t they? My wasted weekend says no. If you re a Sprint user  you can get it to work on T Mobile  eventually  so expect some frustration.That said  battery life is awesome so far. I did change the refresh to 60 HZ from 120 HZ to help it last longer. Fingerprint reader has been flawless for me. Camera is awesome. Android transfer program moved most of my stuff over  although I did have to manually reload about half of my apps. In general  I love this phone.
The phone has a lot going for it. It s fast and has good reception with tmobile. Unfortunately it has some quirks that really hold it back. The fingerprint sensor is absolutely terrible. It fails about half of the time. No matter how good the phone is you will hate it if it rejects you every other time you try to use it. Also if you are looking at the screen in sunlight it will get very dim after a few minutes to the point that it is not usable. I think this is to prevent overheating but I have never seen any other phone do that. Overall this phone is okay but I don t love it.
I bought this phone because it seemed like a good alternative to the more expensive Samsung phones like the S21 or Note 20. I have had Samsung phones exclusively since about 2013 when I bought the Note 3 and thought for sure I would never buy from another manufacturer. At first I was pleased with the phone. Then about 6 weeks after purchase I got out of a movie to find my phone screen had cracked inside my pocket  nothing else was in there at the time. The screen is made of inferior materials to the ones in the flagship phones. I called Samsung customer support  after much back and forth managed to get a refund for the price I paid for the phone. I have a Pixel now and would never go back to Samsung. This phone is poorly designed and breaks easily.
My girlfriend loves it  it s probably the best phone she s ever had. Everything on this FE is amazing the Face recognition is on point  fingerprint reader is fast as he ll and you can store up to three fingers which is awesome. The battery life is well you know it s pretty much the same as all Samsung devices. But all and all it is a great phone and the price you can not beat. I the S21 and the S20 FE is just as good as mine.
Not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews  when there should be 4 s. Why? In June 2021  the sellers posted 8 GB of Ram and the phone only had 6 GB. That s false advertisement. Apparently they change their description off and on.I lose power quicker than I imagined I would. My friend has a Samsung 9 and his power last longer than mine  go figure.It s not a bad phone. Yet  sometimes I do wonder if it was refurbished and not new. Some little odd things here and there.
Bought this phone because my pixel 3 microphone died after two years and I wanted higher quality hardware. This phone has that. Camera is very good (though colors are sometimes a little off compared to Pixel). Microphone is clear  speaker volume is much louder  things load fast  it s waterproof   etc etc. But the Samsung version of Android is extremely annoying to use. My typing is slower than ever  I often must repeat touch inputs multiple times. Fingerprint reader works fine though your fingertip must be at just the right angle  flat to the screen. Auto brightness adjust is awful and when unlocking the phone in a dark room it will flash super bright in your face before correcting. Phone is just large enough that one-handing is difficult  which causes me to tap things I didn t want to and drop it more. Overall  it works fine  or even very well  but it s simply unpleasant to use. I guess they ve got to find some way to remind you that you didn t spring for the ultra expensive flagship phone.
I honestly haven t had any problems with this phone and I ve had it for over a month now. Honestly I think it s a perfect mid-range phone since I wasn t willing to pay flagship prices for the higher end s20 s. This phone is fast and the 120hz makes scrolling flawless. The camera  while not the best on the market  still takes amazing pictures unless you zoom in too much. The battery life lasts way longer than my old phone  I usually don t have to charge until I go to bed. Of course if you re using it all day then the battery will drain quicker  otherwise yes it does last all day. Also I have MetroPCS and had no problems switching to this phone or connecting to the 5G network. Overall  if you looking for a decent but cheaper upgrade then this is the prefect phone!
I am unable to get 5g forever so what s point getting a 5g phone!  as I found out nothing. could not even pick up 4g service with It  so mad after wasting time in Verizon store packed all the time and useless tech support  returned it. I will say it has the best camera in a phone ever seen
the box the phone came in was very dirty  and when I opened the box the phone was very dusty. cleaned everything with lysol wipes. Other then that the phone itself is great! The screen  camera  and battery life are really good. works with my samsung watch 3. Since it is a Samsung phone I figured it would work with my Samsung gear 360 camera  my samsung s9 works perfectly with it. Unfortunately the 360 camera app is not compatible with this phone and will not connect to the camera. Just wanted to give a heads up for anyone that has this camera  I did not see anyone mention this issue.
Other than not having a headphone jack (WHY..???) - I m very happy with this phone. All files including text messages  photos  documents  music - pretty much everything - transferred easily from my old phone to this one. Operating system is pretty much the same - also very nice. Not a fan of Bixby - it was easy to shut off. Stays charged for days. Happy with this purchase  for sure..!!!
WAS going to buy an S21 5G… glad I didn t…This gives you great features PLUS external memory card access… which I d rather have… larger capacity of storage and removable JUST in case phone screws up… most newer phones don t seem to have external... e.g. 5 S21 sHad almost a month and STILL putting in apps I NEED.. lolGREAT pictures and video… super clear with Night Mode…Video and it  SOUND… did a short video in the Van Gogh Immersive Experience with super Loud music… audio was perfect… not overly compressed and sounding true to live as you can get from a PHONE…(I used Master music for TV  Movies  CDs… so DO have an ear… lol)…Anyway... GREAT phone for the $$$
I really like the amount of storage this phone has  but 4 months in and it s been having issues with replaying the motion capture video for pictures. Using double-tap to light up the screen when it s off works probably 70% of the time. Swipe is terrible. I have a tempered glass screen protector on it but I have never had a phone be so bad at swipe with one on. I will try to swipe a word and end up with something completely random or it doesn t recognize the word I obviously swiped (e.g.  adhesive  instead of  aggressive ). My Samsung S7 was better at recognizing than this one. Another issue with swipe is that it ll stop tracking and give you a bunch of jumbled things all broken up like  ch a game .I ve also had issues with certain apps  only with this phone. I am only 4 months into having this phone and I m starting to regret my purchase. Unless it starts improving  I m not sure I feel great about having this -- nor expecting it to last -- the next few years or so.
Purchased the Samsung Galaxy s20 FE 5G as an upgrade from a galaxy s9+. So far  this phone is awesome. Samsung makes the back out of metal instead of glass now  so that s a plus. The color red you see in the images is not the muted red you get in person. It actually looks kind of a metallic and immensely better!!!! There is not a tool in the box to open the sd drawer  it was fortunate we had one from a previous phone so we could activate it and insert the memory card. The charging cable is short  a longer one would be nice. I also like how Samsung did away with the curved edges on the screen.
Upgrading from a Galaxy S6 makes this a very drastic upgrade. Adaptive display makes things scroll smooth  faster hardware makes for a snappy performance  upgraded OS is sweet  fast (enough) face recognition and fingerprint scanner and the camera... Oh the camera. Can t get enough of it.The one thing I d have to say makes me take of half a star is the battery life. A full charge lasts me literally 24hrs. Not sure if it was supposed to  but I was expecting something longer.Other than that.... This phone is excellent!
It took forever to come. I literally got it almost a week after the order date. Amazon told me to file a police report. I was sooo scared it had been stolen but since having it for about a day... it s so far so good. I like it a lot. Fingerprint works well haven t taken many pictures yet but the quality and zoom functions are pretty amazing. I hope it lives up to my expectations. Battery life doesn t last very long but it s not a MAJOR issue. Just holds a slightly less charge.
Got this for my birthday and was frustrated with it out of the box. I have an older Galaxy and fond it meet all my needs. The new Galaxy s20 FE is setup with the side power button automatically opening Bixby. . . total BS. Easy fix once you dig into the setting. The much bigger issue is Bluetooth  or I should say almost Bluetooth. It inconsistently recognizes devices. After multiple attempts finally got earbuds working.Hopefully I can get all the little annoying glitches figured out and make this a phone I won t regret getting.
Compré este teléfono para poder jugar Call of Duty Mobile. Estuve tentado a comprar otro terminal  diseñado específicamente para ese fin. Pero al final me decidí por el Samsung por su estilo que es bastante más refinado y porque  en papel  sus características eran similares. Un buen chip y una buena pantalla con alta taza de refresco. Lamentablemente el teléfono ha tenido algunas fallas. Al principio era software. Problemas con Google Play  con discord y ahora con la lectura de la sim card. Debo reiniciar el teléfono para que los servicios de llamadas  mensajería e Internet funcionen. Es una lástima. Además el software de reconocimiento facial y lectura de huella en pantalla es realmente malo.Por último  la conectividad con accesorios de marcas distintas a Samsung es bastante malo. Tengo una wristband de Xiaomi y la conexión entre el teléfono y la banda y inestable. Debo estar abriendo la aplicación de mifit para que realice la descarga de información constantemente.
So  coming from a Galaxy S7 I m obviously in love with this phone. I have zero complaints. If you customize your phone correctly you ll have more than enough battery life and it charges very fast.The camera is just phenomenal. The phone is light but sturdy  and very easy for me to read as someone in their 40s.I m just very happy with it. I would suggest buying a case on Amazon at the same time because I couldn t find one anywhere in town since it s an FE.
I really looked forward to having a new Samsung. I loved the color  but unfortunately the speaker was not working well and neither was the camera when using the flash. When on a call I d be talking and at random times the other person could not hear me at all. This also happened when I had them on speakerphone. Obviously  this is something very important when it comes to purchasing a phone: the other person must be able to hear you during the call. Next  when taking a photo with the flash in the photo came out really blue and foggy. However  if no flash was used during the day and or night mode the picture came out very nice. I also did notice that the phone s battery percentage would go down when not in use. I ve never had these type of problems with any of the many Samsung phones I ve owned. Hopefully the next one will be alot better as I do not plan on ever switching to an iPhone.
Here it advertises 8GB RAM  but RAM is 6GBAlso  Samsung s website says display is 3200x1440. But that is a lie too. Display is 1080x2400will return this phone. Shame on you Samsung (and Bezos).from website:Galaxy S20 FE 5G 6.5  FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED HID Flat (120Hz) Infinity-O Display (3200x1440) 407 ppi HDR10+ certified 120Hz refresh rate support
Can t beat the price for what you get with this phone! Love it!The camera is amazing  finger print reader is fine  and the speaker is loud. Fluent when browsing. Its like a corvette with world class performance at affordable price. Snapdragon 865  6 gb ram  4500 mah battery size  6.5 inch screen with 120 hz display. Simply unbeatable for the price!!!
I like this phone so much that when mine was smashed intentionally into the concrete  it took two times at full human strength of a 6 foot tall man to make it not work anymore. I did not hesitate to replace it with the same SAMSUNG Galaxy S20 FE 5G. The phone is great value for the money I spent. I also recommend this too. https://www.amazon.com/Supershieldz-Samsung-Tempered-Protector-Scratch/dp/B08KFPG514/ref=pd_rhf_ee_s_rp_c_2_5/144-6656309-3446512?pd_rd_w=9j7YN&pf_rd_p=c5176ee3-b609-4196-9e4e-395444c24cf6&pf_rd_r=BDX5XCHK1A6WH7VR80A1&pd_rd_r=51830fd5-f828-4c59-b33e-a7d6c5e8e88d&pd_rd_wg=3qwHk&pd_rd_i=B08KFPG514&psc=1
It meets most of my expectations it s a very smooth and quick phone. I haven t seen any of the issues stated yet though I will say the battery doesn t hold as long as was stated and the only issue I ve had so far is my phone kept freezing when I would click on the wifi button and when I went to restart the phone it wouldn t turn back on after 20mins. It s fine now but time will tell.
The media could not be loaded.  It does not work. It is a bad phone for the cost. the display fails and it is a general failure. also when returning it  amazon charges you 100 dollars to accept the return even though they sent a useless product
It s an pretty solid phone:+ Has pro features: * Fast charging compatibility * Wireless charging * Fast refresh screen at 120hz+ It makes the correct compromises: * Plastic rear with a nice finish  doesn t feel cheap * No curve screen (for some people its a plus)- Cons: * The included charger isn t the fast charger that matches the phone capability. * Doesn t include any extras: * No phone case * No earphones * No USB-C to headphone jack converter
You re always taking a gamble when you re ordering from a reseller  and it s always the luck of the draw on what you ll get. I m a full-on nerd and would notice anything wrong or glitchy about a phone not to mention the way it looks... In my case I got an impeccable phone that performs impeccably and I couldn t be happier...My advice is to take the chance on this reseller and buy your phone. If it ends up being crap you can always send it back because you re buying from Amazon
This is the worse phone I have ever owned. 😫 many great features. The one thing you rely want it for is for communication. This phone will not let me have conversations for over 5 minutes on some occasions I ve gotten 10 minutes. When it started cutting me off is was not often but now I can not keep any conversation without being cut off. Frankly face recognition or fingerprint mean nothing if you can t use the phone for its primary purpose. For $600 I m extremely disappointed.
The phone is unlocked but some services will have problems adding it and will insist it s already been attached to a carrier. Fingerprint reader isn t great with glass screen protector and for some reason all glass screen protectors come with a hole for the front facing camera so fuzz builds up making the image quality poor.I have no qualms with the phone itself though. Works great  it s fast. Restarts amazingly fast. Great photo quality even with the fe version.
This American version of this phone does not support a dual sim. I am not sure why phone manufacturers think Americans do not want a dual sim capability  but I have two phone numbers and I want them in the same phone. I sent it back. Otherwise its a very nice phone.
I give the phone four and half stars for fast speedy performance  great cameras  fast battery charging  great price  and excellent expandable MicroSD card storage capacity up to 1TB. The only thing I like to see improved is the amount of RAM. The smartphone comes with 6GB of RAM. I already have 3GB of RAM used. Like to see at least 8GM of RAM. I also like the fact the phone is unlocked. You can take the smartphone to the carrier of your choice.
These slippery glass  expensive toys are too hard to handle - securely. Aside from the hundred of dollars  they are a pain to move from a broken one to a new one  a pain to reconfigure too. The Samsung S20 series are best of breed  whatever you will use it for  it is versatile  flexible  and there is an  ap  for it that will do whatever you want any cell to do! It is sized to fit my hand  I think that it will fit your hand too. You ll need a teenager to get it going  configured for you and the flexibility is totally awesome. there are erbatteries in other phones  but this will cover you from sunrise to sunset.
I got this phone today and as soon as I got the phone  I install the Touch Screen test application from play store to check the touch screen issue. I can clearly notice that this model of samsung have ghost touch issue. I really liked the phone and it could be a flagship killer phone. But  due to this issue I have to return this phone.
I have not yet used the fingerprint or face recognition features. I fear that I may not have this phone for 2-3 years - my usual phone life. This phone is sometimes hot  even while sitting there unused  and sometimes it overheats while charging. Other than that  I really like the phone  it is a little big (with a case  it does not fit the phone holder in my Toyota)  but It is easy to use. I like that I can insert an SD card for storage - this is the reason that I purchased the S20 FE 5G  and not the S21.
Biggest thing is that is you have to buy separate ear phones for this phone as the ones I had before do not work with this phone. I love the fingerprint reader. Battery life is good. I do not use the facial recognition so really do not have much to say about it. I ve heard complaints about the size of the phone. I have no complaints. I absolutely love the amount of storage this phone has 128 G. This is one of the reasons I chose this phone.
Perhaps one of the best phones on the market at a decent price.Camera is spot on great face unlock and a great display i have owned a galaxy s10 plus and never utilized the quad HDThis phones battery will last much longer than an s20 because its bigger and its resolution is not hitting that 1440P.s its 120hz is addictive
I was so excited to finally get a decent phone and I was looking into this one because I really care about the camera quality. According to my husband this was good phone. I went ahead and bought it. It s been a while since I ve paid a lot for a cell phone because all I needed it for mainly was for calling/ texting/ pictures. Since my old phone doesn t take good pictures I asked my husband for a camera or a better cell phone that took good pictures. Everything went fine until I wasn t able to download or accept group messages or pictures. Also  I usually listen to music on my way home from work and Pandora didn t work at all. It kept skipping the music and at times it would work  but other times it wouldn t. I spoke to a Amazon Tech  I went online on google to look for ways to try and fix these issues. I restarted the phone  clear the data  the cache. I tried everything I could and it wasn t working. I returned it because I want a phone that actually works. It might just be a defective phone  but not satisfied especially since I had bought all the protection for this phone ahead of time.
Total piece of crap waste of money. Half the time I can t hear people on the phone. It freezes  touch screen doesn t work properly. It s as if this phone was released way too soon before it was ready. It was a pretty inexpensive galaxy tho so I thought why not. Now  I know why not. BTW the camera on S8 has better looking photos.My husband is watching my struggles with this phone and he s using it as an opportunity to say  see  I told you you should ve gone with an iphone . As an android loyalist  this is extremely disappointing and infuriating.
This is a bad phone.screen response time  launcher and functionality is very irritating.Some people want a sleek  responsive and UI that is intuitive. This phone has none of these essential qualities.When I refresh this phone again  I will never look at Samsung.please look elsewhere and save yourself buyer s remorse.
I purchased this at discounted price and waited til it was in stock and then shipped. It easily was set up with service with Tracfone using T Mobile SIM 5G. The camera on this phone is unlike any other phone I have had. I love it!! Was worth every penny I paid for it. I do not feel that is heavy  clumsy  etc...Color is beautiful!
Cameras - check  with good zoom up to 10x (more is so-so).Battery life - check  with 2 days of use.Screen - check  gorgeous AMOLED with fast refresh rate.Fast CPU - check  Snapdragon 865  games are flying.Carrier LTE compatibility - check  see kimovil website.Brand name - check  Samsung FTW.Friendly price - check!Anti-bloatware - check  see xda website.???Profit!
I was so excited to get this phone on Amazon prime day and it has turned out to be the worst phone ever!! I loved the fact the volume is so loud  however it cuts out daily on speaker and just cuts out in general. I am so sorry I bought this phone and unfortunately couldn t return it within the return window because I was sick with Covid and covid pneumonia. Don t waste your money!
Phone has mind of its own. Closes apps while using them. Have call apps to identify and block private numbers no matter the app or membership type it doesn t not do what it should. Battery life drains very fast. Tells me my passwords and thumbprint don t match . Key board does what it wants. Example: if I type cat  the keyboard will do this caaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I type correct spelling and it autocorrects to sjsksbejdjsksns. So disappointed I m thinking of switching to apple
Great phone so far! The technological differences can be seen in comparison to my old S8+. The Samsung S20 FE is way faster  the cameras are way better  and it looks way cleaner.Crazy how affordable this phone is for what you get from it. Definitely would recommend!
We were looking for new phones and got these on prime day. We didn t even have to get a new sim card  so there was no hassle whatsoever. We just traded the cards ans transferred the stuff on our phones over. So far so good. I am not as impressed as I thought I would be with battery life as my old phone which is a little bit of a disappointment  but otherwise they work fine so far
I bought this during amazon prime day to replace mu google pixel 3a. It s great  there s nothing else to say about it. Face id works great  fingerprint reader works great  fast processor  great streaming quality (if you know what i mean 👀)  and camera is pretty good  nothing compared to flagship phones but it s still better then most phones. Overall  8/10  8 because though everything else is good  it can t run high end games  like Genshin Impact.
Bought 1 year ago. This Samsung FE20 5G does everything perfectly! !Best phone I ever had. Have owned 9 phones in last 18 years. Not one single issue.Samsungs are awesome !
Excellent phone! Been using it for a month now it works perfect with my knock off carrier total wireless.. I have a car  screen protector  camera glass protector. It s going to last me a long while.
This phone has a lot of fun features and options  love the camera  and the white back doesn t show fingerprints. Unfortunately I m not able to review some features of the phone because it is not yet serviceable. This is really up to the buyer to contact your service provider first  of course. Spectrum (specifically) does not service this unlocked device until sometime maybe in January 2021. Possibly to due with 5G service and it being a super new device. Just an FYI as we re now left with two brand new wonderful phones without service and two quickly dying old phones trying to hang in there another month.
Well  it s early days yet  however  unit functioning smoothly. Forgot to purchase SD card  though will not be in need for just now. Going through features  and will update review  at a later date. In the meanwhile  can easily recommend to others. Pricing could be somewhat reduced  in reflection of other units observed within that price range. One dislike  the bloating of unessential apps.  maybe to justify cost. IDK.
I put in my old Verizon SIM card and it works! Much faster than my old Samsung J7V. Fast forward 3 months. I tried to switch to Xfinity (supposedly uses Verizon equipment) and the IMEI search said it is not compatible. I can switch to AT&T but they suck here.
Overall the phone works pretty well. Biggest issue found so far is getting a good screen protector that works well with the fingerprint reader. None of the tempered glass ones we tried worked well. Ended up using a soft type.The biggest concern is OS updates from Samsung. Compared to Apple as android phones don t seem to get updates promptly and support is not as long as an iPhone from what we can tell.
I went from a Samsung 7 edge to a Google pixel 3 thinking I would have better pictures and a better phone. After 2 years of not being happy with pixel I chose Samsung S20 fe. I love this phone! Cameras are above expectations as well as all other aspects of the phone. Very responsive and easy to use. Goodbye Google Pixel 3. Only issue would be I thought I was buying a new phone  I have been unable to verify if refurbished. Box was sealed  a little dirty but phone was clean. I highly recommend Samsung S20 fe!
I did a lot of research before coming to a conclusion to purchase this particular phone and let me tell you  this phone is beyond perfect  a MASSIVE upgrade from my Samsung galaxy S6 edge+. The battery life is superb  the multiple options to customize the UI is amazing  the security that this phone provides is simply phenomenal. You as the user have full control on how you want your phone to behave. And to top it all off  at an affordable price! (Bought this phone when it was at $600 maybe you can get it at the same price or better) Why pay more for something similar when you can pay less for the same thing or better?
I like the phone a lot. The fingerprint reader is almost as good a a dedicated button  but absolutely up to snuff for regular use. Facial recognition is good as well. I have had none of the touch screen bugs after 1 month of use.Phone is snappy and fast processing. 5G is awesome if it s available to you. (I m on t-mobile)Camera is very good  love the 3x optical zoom.120hz is a bit of a battery drainer so I mostly use 60hz when I m out and about. With that I get all day use.Overall for the price this is a winner.
I m so disappointed I got a buggy phone  its like I got a refurbished one. Google closes on its own  and some apps do not work right  which works fine on my 5 year old phone.
I have been using this phone for almost a month and it s amazing. It s superfast and smoothe. The battery life on this phone is really good. It also takes a short time to recharge. The display is beautiful and my favorite feature is the dolby atmos sound that comes from both speakers. With the high refresh rate the battery life is still excellent. A decision you would not regret. Buy it!
Haven t even had the phone for a month yet. Love it. Unfortunately  without even doing anything to it the screen developed a hair line crack across it. Really annoyed and I ve been a Samsung user forever. I haven t even dropped the phone yet and it s doing this. Very bad quality. Going to try to return it. I m assuming this thing is defective. Will update once it is replaced with a different phone.
This is a gem of a phone. Perfect size  high end performance at a mid range price. Superb battery goes for DAYS with moderate usage. Can stream Netflix for 12+ hours on a charge and still have 20 percent left. Premium hardware  Samsung fully supports the US version so you get all the updates. I like the  unlocked by Samsung  setup  no crippling carrier trash or branding. Using mine on Mint Mobile (T-Mobile MVNO)  get full 5G performance and seeing 500-600MB down inside my home.This isn t the cheapest phone but why play stupid games with carrier financing scams when you can  buy once  cry once  and get a great phone that you have the freedom to use with any carrier/MVNO and get the full Android experience on solid hardware that will last 2-3 years. I m very happy with mine and I think you will be too.
I am so happy with my purchase I ordered my phone in my fiancee s phone on a Sunday and both products came Monday at a decent time before we ate dinner the phones were great battery life is great everything about this phone is awesome I love that I can get ex ternal storage in internal storage I love the fact that this phone were able to put SD card in otherwise I wouldn t get that Galaxy S21 but I am so satisfied with my purchase and everything about this phone works amazingly him I just couldn t be more happy
Coming from S9 i was hesitant to got with this phone  lower screen resolution but higher frame rate wasnt enough..I was also afraid the phone wouldnt be legit in Samsung Amazon store but wanted it asap  have prime so decided to buy it..Came aoon enough  I dont do pics so the phone camara is not a biggy for me.But i am blown away  the phone is quick  firgerprint reader work fast.. the position of it from the old S9 to S20fe is akward  i am used to the S9 firgerprint location but I am adapting.Has all i need   Samsung pay  Secure folder.. though now u cant set a specific fingerprint to Secure folder  maybe they will fix that in updates..Averall  impressed with it .. it is big.. and fast.. didnt needed to buy the flagship at all. This one has all I need.
After some research  I settled on this S20 FE 5g. It has flagship features for a reasonable price. Better than the S21 as I ve learned. After using an iphone 5s for many years  wanted a 5G phone with wiresless charging  expandable memory  fast processor  more ram and at least a 4500 mah battery to last a few days. Also got a notice that At&t was ending their 3G network in February so it was time. The mint green was out of stock from Amazon but luckily I found one from this seller in used but brand new condition with at 90 day seller and Amazon warranty. Expected it to take a few weeks to get here but got it 2 days later. It came in the original packaging with all the accessories. Plastic wrap still on the back and sides of phone. Works great so far. Would buy from this seller again. Checked with Samsung Support and was informed that there was still a manufacturer warrany on it. So far so good. Just relieved to have a phone that works fast and last all day.
This phone is everything you could ask for in a phone. The camera on this phone out performs the IPhone 12. All my friends with an IPhone were jealous of the camera. The camera is my favorite thing. 30× zoom is amazing. I could take pictures of animals from a good distance away without scaring them off. Incredible. I have had no trouble at all with this phone. There is zero lag. 120 hertz display is gorgeous. You will love this phone. It s a steal for 600 bucks
I ve had this phone for a few months now and I m definitely happy with its overall performance and ability to power through what I ask it to. The camera is decent enough and it behaves like flagship without the price. It certainly outperforms my Samsung a71 which simply gave up on life after a year. That being said  the biggest issue I have with this phone is that battery just seems to lose percentage at an alarming rate for a new phone. I don t know if it s the battery chemistry or the systems taxing the phones systems but  the battery on this phone drains on par with my s10+ after I had it for a year. The thing I always demand out of my phones is a strong battery and this one is middling for something fresh out of the box.Oh and  the 5g hasn t blown me away either... I can t tell the difference between 4g and 5g  but that could be my provider and not the phone.In short  decent phone  good specs  battery makes this phone not perfect.
I purchased this for my parents to replace the old Galaxy S9+. Unfortunately I will have to return it because it seems to be either defective or too cheaply made with too many corners cut. First of all  the haptic feedback and vibration in general is very weak and doesn t feel as punchy as on S9+. Second of all  the display has worse color uniformity  you can notice the differently colored display areas at all angles. Last but most important - the automatic brightness is either buggy or completely broken  the phone decreases the brightness every time I lock it and when I unlock it - it does not increase the brightness to previous value (even in same room lighting) and keeps display very dim unless I am in a very bright room. This phone is not worth its current price for me with all the issues I have seen.
I am coming from a Samsung 7 and loved it. The battery was going and was debating of putting in another. I decided to go with the 5G option. It s the future. Screen is beautiful  vibe  camera is better than the 7 which I thought was good. Would buy again  and it was a great price when I purchased it.
I had earlier given this phone a 1 star when I thought it had no SD slot... but with the help of a friend... I located the slot behind the sim slot...this would have been explicitly stated in a diagram... but that I did not see ... am updating my review to 4 Star will increase or decrease my rating based on how the phone performs.
We have two Samsung S20 Fe 5G smartphones. We purchase one directly from T-Mobile locked to T-Mobile we purchased this phone from Amazon unlocked. We had T-Mobile installed this phone on T-Mobile network. This phone will NOT connect to 5G T-Mobile network whereas the phone I purchased from T-Mobile will connect. All settings on both phones are identical.
Phone works great  big improvement and upgrade from my ancient Galaxy S5 LOL. Runs quick and is nice to not have the carriers bloatware installed. Screen is sharp and bright  120hz is also a plus. Been using my phone much more since upgraded to this.Update  if you want 5g to work with ATT Prepaid  make sure you update your IMEI number online or at the store.
I ve had this phone for 3 days. The only problem I cam across was when someone called while hooked up to my earbuds the call was not showing on my phone at all. I would hit the phone button and it would take me to recent calls or the keypad  I also tried pulling the top menu down to see if it would show as a notification but nothing. Kind of weird. Other than that  the phone was packaged great.I used it on Cricket first then put the sim in for Metro. Truly unlocked no problems at all! Packaged great. I will update if anything changes
4 months ago I bought this and it works really well. No missing features or glitches. I use AT&T with 5g and it works really well. Camera is really nice. Snapdragon 865 is extremly fast! It came with a standard 15w charger but I had a spare 25w charger lying around. My only regret was I wish I had gotten the white colored one but wasn t in stock at the time.
Ok so I bought a new phone since TMobile kept blaming my Google Pixel 3A on my bad service ( dropped calls  no connection  no internet) and I am still having the same problems. Also I hate the biometric reader on the front! Backside is much more natural and convenient. Pictures are nice battery is about the same. So really mad I could have waited a while longer to shell out for a new phone and accessories.
My phone all of a sudden stopped recognizing the sim that was in my phone after working perfectly fine for 8 months. You can t get it warrantied through Samsung unless the proof of purchase has the IMEI number on it. I had to send my phone in twice to try and get repaired. Dealing with Samsung supports has been awful. I also purchased the 2 year protection plan that s a joke because they wont help till the manufacture warranty is expired. what a night mare. HEY SELLER get the the IMEI numbers on the invoice/receipt so we can get the device fixed if it breaks for no reason.
I am loving my new phone. It takes a little time trying to get used to the new phone. The battery life is wonderful compared to my galaxy 7 phone. I can not get the fingerprint reader to work for me. I m trying the face recognition now.
I ve always been happy with Samsung smartphones. After a lot of research  primarily focused on the camera and video capabilities  I went with this one. Oops. It does not follow action well and is a step down from my prior Samsung S10+. I use this for my everyday  but for pictures and video streaming I pulled out my old phone. My daughter also says the selfie mode is lacking.
I can t downplay the reviews from other users because their opinions and needs are different than mine. I almost did not purchase because of certain reviews but I m glad I did because so far this phone has been amazing. I came from a Moto G5s plus and I can see a big difference already  in a good way. There are a few features I will have to get used to  but I can adapt. The only downside so far is only having 3 fingerprints to use to unlock your phone  but that s minor. I definitely recommend. In my opinion  you won t be disappointed.
The battery life is great and lasts longer than any other phone I ve had. When using it I immediately noticed how fast and smooth it was from switching between apps and playing games and scrolling on Insta. I absolutely love it. I m glad Samsung ditched the glass backs and went back to something more solid. It has a good size screen and nice weight to it. I added a Spigen case and screen protector.
Just received these phones  we upgraded our house to three Galaxy S20 s on Prime-Day Sale  we can t complain thus far. Very responsive and manageable with one hand. Easy to transfer over all files  easy to get the phone activated and running.... pull the sim form the old phone and pop it into the new GS20  start it up and on the 5G Hwy...I recommend so far *thumbs up*
Brand new phone. Seems to be fully unlocked as I m using in Dominican Republic and all company s sim cards works perfectly.I haven t encountered any issues with it. Battery life could be better but maybe is because I m too happy to stop playing with it lol.Camera could be better  specially the  30x zoom  which is bs  but I didn t really buy it for the camera so I don t care.
Purchased last year. At first this was a great phone. Great battery life. Had a problem with constantly restarting which was eventually fixed by a software update. I upgraded my AT&T service to 5g. Didn t work so I went to an AT&T store to fix. They said it s the phone.
I have used a Samsung S6 Active for years but I finally purchased a new phone. I really miss the ease of shutting down or restarting the phone. You should never have to watch a video to find out how to do this simple task but it is a requirement here. Even then I forget and have to go out and search the net on how to do it again  again... Otherwise  it is a OK phone.
What I like about this phone:It s faster and newer than my old Samsung J7  to be fair any 2020 phone is probably better than an old J7.Love the wireless charging. I like the bigger screen and image quality is super nice  even compare to other 2020 phones. Sound is clear  even at maximum volume.What I wish it had:Expandable memory slotI know other versions have it  this one doesn t. Storage is 128gb  which is plenty since I usually don t keep important files in my phone. Encrypted files in the cloud 😊As far as 5G is concerned  it works well but there at times is really slow  so it s off for now.In summary  I am very happy with this phone.
The difference between my old reliable 4G phone and this one could be measured in light-years. This phone is phenomenally fast and easy to set up. The fan apparently did an excellent job in determining the factors to be included in the Fan Edition. It is so fast I had a near a quicker touch on the screen with my finger or I found myself lost. Super responsive  and clear and crisp display of vivid colors. I am enamored and likely to get in trouble as I can t stop fiddling with my phone to do my work.
I bought the larger memory version of this phone (256 gb)  plus the ability to store videos on the removable memory chip. I volunteer for a concert organization and often record shows. So far  so good.This phone doesn t support the Verizon UW 5G - but it does support the lower band 5G. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the services that use Verizon cell service do not support this phone - I m stuck with Verizon (luckily   Verizon knocked off $10 per line for autopay). It s kinda strange  since at least one of the services support this phone.Otherwise  the phone price and features are sweet for an unlocked device.
Phone came wrapped in the proper packing material and a samsung super fast charger  phone was as expected with a few barely noticeable scratches. Other than the screen scratches the phone is pretty much out of the retail box. Definitely legitimate samsung product for a lot less. The phone itself runs very smooth and was indeed factory unlocked  the in screen optical fingerprint reader is pretty fast and accurate  the face recognition uses the phones 32mp front camera and could use some work  but is still fairly reliable. Great and fast phone even in 2021  if you can get a good deal on a S20 FE 5G  it s definitely worth it
Overall I like this phone very much after a few weeks use. It replaced a Samsung Galaxy S7  so there was no particular learning curve.What I don t like is no fault of the hardware. The location and lock screen functions did not work well on the S7  and they don t on this phone either. That may be because of operator error.
Forget the hype over the expensive  bank-breaking phones. The S20 FE is the next best thing  performs extremely well  takes great photos and video and does just about all the phones costing much more will do. The best part is you get to keep a few bucks in your pocket.
I like the phone overall. it is pretty speedy and the battery life is very good. I am not a camera connoisseur so I can t comment on whether the camera is all that it s supposed to be but it seems good. I will say that both the fingerprint reader and the face recognition our spotty at best. I often need to use my unlock code but that is easy. I ve only had it a couple of months but so far so good. I am not sure that it is worth the extra money over a phone that s about half the price for someone who doesn t really use the camera.
I switched from the Samsung A12 to this. I was sent one of these phones and realized quickly that the battery life was not good. My old phone had a better battery. So I sent it back and got another sent. This seems to have slightly better battery but wont last me all day. I can get through probably 8 or 9 hours of on and off use on this phone before having to charge. Considering I got it on sale I would say the $100 dollar savings compensates for this but still a little upset.
I just got this phone 3 months ago and it fell put of my pocket (2ft. At most) and my screen completely shattered. As you can see from the pictures  my case took no damage. I called Samsung and they had no answer when I asked them about their  indestructible gorilla glass . It would have cost me $265 to replace my screen. So now I am out the $599 it cost me for this phone and now another $399 to replace the entire phone. Honestly  for as poor of quality as Samsung is putting out there now I think my next phone will be with Apple.
Just got it yesterday  and so far I am very happy with the phone. I upgraded from an S7 Galaxy  this one is much faster and has a lot of great features. The changeover of my data was fairly painless as well. I think most people would be happy with it. Wasn t too sure about the color when I ordered it   but I find that it is kind of nice to have one that doesn t blend in with whatever I put it down on. Also nice to have one that doesn t look like every other phone out there!
I m in love with this phone  and I m not even a phone person. I had grown increasingly unimpressed by the IPhone family of phones. I have an acquaintance who has the Note  and I began researching Samsung products. The picture is so vivid when I play a video  the camera is wonderful. I could go on and on... I think I m sold on the Samsung mobile phone line!
Vengo de un samsung j7 (2016) y tener este celular es tan bello  es un gran cambio me agrada tanto  me encanta que venga desbloqueado de fábrica  soy de Honduras tengo Red Tigo y me funcionó al 100% desde la primera vez que le puse el chip  no me toco andar activando el celular y gastando de más  el reconocimiento facial no lo he probado  el lector de huella siento que le cuesta siempre tengo que poner mi dedito mínimo dos veces porque no lo reconoce  creo que se descarga un poco rápido  esta en 100% me pongo a jugar un ratito y ya lo tengo en 97 y un juego que no es taan difícil (Beach buggy)   aveces siento que se caliente por la parte de arriba al lado de la cámara por creo que es porque paso pegada en el cel todo el día y la temperatura ambiental acá no ayuda  cuando lo pongo a cargar carga rápido en aproximadamente 1 hora y 10 o 30 mints.  la cámara trasera es sensacional me encanta su modo de noche es muy nitida  la cámara delantera no me dejo muy feliz si no estas en buenas condiciones de luz se verá rara la foto  el video en 4k está asombroso  tiene buenas funciones el celular  la verdad lo recomiendo un montón el color es bello. En su caja solo venía el celular  el cargador y algunos papeles. Si estas interesado en este celular compralo  es una buena elección  no te arrepentirás.
Worked amazing the first 2 days  after that the battery life has gotten worse and worse.The storage space is fantastic.By  lavender  they actually mean pink.
I like the idea of this phone  take last year s flagship processor and build a cheaper quality phone around it. In practice  this is a 200$ xiaomi phone with worse cameras and batteries.In performance and network features this thing is great. The ram and processor are great  so why did you slap these inferior 12mp grainy cameras on! Ya ll even put in an SD card slot!Good lord this could have been the phone to DESTROY this mid range market... But Samsung missed it by a hair!Honestly if it had a better camera and an aux port I would have been recommending it to everyone who had any care for phones and tech... But not with this 500$ poco phone equivalent with worse camera
I purchased this phone for a replacement for my Motorola X4. I liked the color so decided not to buy a case however the phone is so slick that it kept sliding off various surfaces so I am waiting for my new clear case case to arrive. Fingerprint reader is very quick but the facial recognition is sporadic particularly compared to my daughters Apple 12. Speed is very good and the 90htz refresh is good but it eats more battery so I would switch to 60htz if not gaming. Power off icon is more difficult to use than it should be.
The camera is fantastic! Many settings. Exceptional pictures. Love all the memory. You can t go wrong with 1Terrabite with a sim card. Plus the memory of the phone. The phone was perfect. Brand new. Came quick and easy set up. Very pleased!
I am hooked on Samsung  and have used straighttalk forever. I am not a  put it on my plan  type. I am still finding new things on my phone! I love it  super happy with purchase. Quick shipping  packaged well.
This was my first recent Android phone. I had used iPhones for years  after retiring my old Galaxy S5 years ago.I was absolutely blown away. For the price  this is an absolutely amazing phone. It s still a full-blown flagship  just with a plastic back and minus a camera. Huge battery. Maybe closer to the S20+ than the regular S20.I loved it so much  I decided to trade it in for a Galaxy S21+. But if you re not a tech snob like me  the S20 FE is a flagship without the extra flair.
The phone is totally unlocked and works with gsm card of differents counries(USA and Argentina  for instance). Also works great and the cameras are excelents  also the screen is crystal clear. I think this phone is a bang for the buck! The transition from from my old S9 was without any glitch.
Everything was great until the third day when I couldn t make any phone calls. I could hear people on the phone  but they could not hear me talk. They wanted me to factory reset the phone every time this happened which was three times in one day.
After my mom was nagging me for a new phone (Motorola doesn t really hold up IMO)  I bought her this one on the payment plan. So far she seems to love it  and I do notice the faster screen refresh compared to my S10e (Comparable to my Note I gave away). Its too big IMO but she loves it so I love it
Much faster than my Google Pixel 3. Worked like a charm right out of the box. Easy SIM card swap. I need to get used to the controls  as I have had Google phones for years. Fingerprint reader is perfect. Set it up to read your thumbprint . That way you can do everything with only one hand.
Bought this phone for my wonderful wife. She absolutely loves it. It s a very pretty device. Not much more I can say about it because I don t use it. I can tell you that I m waiting for the S 21s to take hold so I can afford to buy a new S 20 Ultra. See you in the funny papers  lol
This is my first Samsung as I have only had LG in the past. I am an android plan and have used iPhone but not owned. Setup took awhile but that may have been user not the device itself. Many features including ones I have not tried yet. Takes great pictures for a phone which is what I was looking for. Very satisfied his first month of use. Used with tracking. Slim design and large screen but not too large for my smaller hands. Love it so far.
Definitely use a proper case with this phone. The screen shattered the very first time I dropped it. the front panel uses an older  cheaper  less crack resistant gorilla glass than the flagship models have. Even with a solid case the screen may still shatter if you are a klutz who drops their phone frequently. The battery life is enough to last most people a day to a day and a half. The fingerprint reader is slower and less reliable than either of my previous two phones (S9+ and OnePlus 7T)  but it does work. The 120hz display is great!
I had a green tint when i would put the brightness below below 20% probably which would make other apps have a kind of gray and blurry view on the phone. After reading the comments i disregarded them because I knew about the phone but unfortunately I got a defected one . My mom and uncle got the same phone and theirs are fine and work great but i think I ll buy a different phone after returning. I noticed it right after the box so I personally didn t get to experience the phone for more then an hour before boxing it up again.
This phone is THE BOMB!! I absolutely love it 😀. Although  I am upgrading from a Samsung galaxy S7... kinda a big upgrade  but I can tell you  this phone is worth it. I loads fast  its stylish  and it comes in many colors. The only issue I ve had is I can t find many good cases for the phone in store around me. This phone at the moment is still kinda new  so finding a good case can be a little bit of a challange.
Legitimately love this phone  probably my favorite phone so far. It s lightweight  thin  sturdy build  fingerprint reader and face unlock work tremendously well. Comes with Android 12 out the box  cameras are amazing. Processor is smooth and amazing all day battery. Overall  perfect phone. It s a Samsung  so you can t expect anything but the best.
Going from an older IPhone to this Android has proven to be a bit of a learning curve for a senior citizen. We purchased this phone because it was hearing aid compatible. We ve had a bit of problem syncing the phone and the hearing aids but that may be more the app than the phone. It has a great battery life and the camera is good.
The FE additions to Galaxy phones gives you most all of the high end features without the high end cost! Great cameras  easy to use and a great phone like all Samsung Galaxy phones. Finally replaced my trusty S7 edge with this phone.Change over from old apps to this phone could not be easier.
When I took the clear plastic off of the front screen protector it had some dust on it and when I tried to clean it the finger print circle got some dust on it and I tried to fix it but that only made it worse. I think there should be something in the instructions that says whatever you do don t touch that spot. Now I have to send it back and my phone will be unprotected until the new case comes.
I love my Samsung fan edition. It does absolutely everything I need to use it for. It did not come with a user manual (fortunately I bought a book that showed me wonderful short cuts and useful information) I did have one incident of overheating with no obvious cause. I turned it off and did not use it for several hours. It has not done it again. Battery life is exceptional!
The 2020 Black Friday price ($549) made Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G a great deal at Amazon. It is a function-rich phone with good quality. Everything works as expected. I have no problem with it so far. It does feel a little bulky and heavy  needing some time to get use to it.
What can I say  if you looking for a phone to last and with all the newest technology that the 1000 dollar phone have  then this is the one. It does everything great and for the price it s amazing. I picked it up for 550 brand new and I m Happy with my purchase samsung.
The reviews are right. This is an awesome phone. People say its great for the money but that I feel degrades the perception associated with it. This phone does everything I need it to do but be advised the speakers seem a little soft  the fingerprint scanner is a little laggy. The batter however is a monster . Nothing to complain about. Love this device I think I made a smart choice
The phone does not have visual voicemail mail. You can t pull up the phone see who left you messages! That totally blows. Deal breaker  had I known.The phone comes with a micro card slot  and takes up to 1 TB cards. Try that Apple.Battery life is great.Also the contact charger  erases the card. Doh!I would not purchase again!
Battery life is good and WAY more storage and memory than my old phone. But no plug for my earbuds and I don t like the wireless type earbuds.
The reviews say this phone will work with Xfinity mobile. Not true  I spent over an hour with Xfinity rep  and they found out the only S20 that will work  are ones they sell. No other unlocked Samsung S20 phones will work with them.
Its a really pleasant looking phone  the camera is pretty good  I ve gotten some really nice pictures out of it but it s kinda a pain in my @ss. The screen is super touchy and it ll think I m touching something when my hands aren t even on it. The battery life is solid and the call quality is nice. I don t think it s worth 600$ and honestly I preffered my old galaxy j7 but unfortunately it broke and the only thing I could do was upgrade. Overall it s a decent phone  works fine  just a bit annoying and not very friendly for non tech savvy people.
my refurbished phone is less than a week old and apps are crashing. yes i cleared all the caches.calls with headphones are terrible and echo-y.i havent had it long enough to discover new problems
I ve been buying Samsung phones for over 10 years. This one is terrible.... way too big...I jab be large hands and need 2 to hold it... will not fit in your pocket. Very heavy  battery lasts 1.5 days brand new out of the box. The camera that was raved about is only slightly better than my old s7.
Returning my Samsung s20 FE 5g.Maybe I just got lemon  but my phone got frozen screen 5 6 times in first two weeks and than reboots  not acceptable for new phone and 6gig ram. Also fingerprint reader is horrible  face unlock works good though.Battery life not what expected for 4500mh.Touchscreen is not always responsive  especially on the corners of the screen.Thing that I liked is great display/resolution.I would stay away from this phone  on paper everything seems amazing  in reality too many issues.
By far the best phone we ve ever had. Great photos. I doubt I ll ever figure out how to use it to it s full capabilities. Thanks Samsung.
For the price it s OK. Fingerprint reader is just ok. Battery life is great. I wish it had dual front speakers. I like that it has expandable storage. Samsung apps store has the Epic app with Fortnite. It also has a FREE app to watch select movies and shows. (Walking dead included with ads)
This phone sold at a much better price than any of the other places I looked.The battery life is really good. After heavy use there was still 50% battery at the end of the day.My wireless company was very helpful in getting it set up and transferring all the data.The old phone was getting tired and slow. This one is much faster
This phone is terrible. The screen randomly goes black all the time  in all applications. Happens during texting  in email  search engines  social media apps  games. I will be returning it as soon as I can figure out which one to replace it with. Also  every time the black screen flashes it does a hit on the battery life. Have lost nearly 60% battery power in six hours  and I ve had this phone less than two weeks. It was new in the box when purchased.
Battery holds up ok  drains from 100 to about 93 percent within 10 to 15 min of very minimum use after taking it off the charger. After that  battery last all day. Screen is fluid and processor is fast. The finger print reader is a bit slow. Face unlock is very quick. Camera quality is great. Night time picture looks as if it was taken at sunset.Would love to see the 8 gb ram version in the 5g model. Overall the price is decent for a mid range phone.
This replaced a Samsung Galaxy S6 which was good for years but didn t last long on a charge anymore.Great screen and camera  lots of advanced features  and excellent battery life. I transferred everything over from the old S6 with the Samsung SmartSwitch program over the network and that worked perfectly.
Bluetooth don t work will not sync. Voice command is retarded  it will some times make the correct words and then re-change them to something stupid. ALSO will will Stop recording in mid sentence  after about two seconds. MAJOR REGRET buying this phone. Very little i like about this phone so far.. my old phone was great (Not Samsung).
Upgrading from an S8 and disappointed to see the multifunction rgb led is discontinued  it lacks a blood O2 and pulse sensor  it s significantly bigger screen and weight. But this is the closest I could find with micro SD and a decent processor that s also 5G. My S8 lasted a solid 4 years I just don t see this one doing the same.
Phone didnt work and I had to pay to ship it back.
This phone hit almost all the checkmarks I had for a new phone. Besides the price  on sale for $549 on cyber Monday  it has a flat screen and no glass in the back - main reasons I stayed away from a regular S20.. It s also larger than the S20.. Performance is great; it s fast  has a great display  and a very responsive finger print reader.. Very pleased so far! Knock wood!
My only complaint is that I bought this when it was the latest technology. A couple of weeks after I bought it they came out with the S-21. How are we supposed to stay up to date when they push them out so fast. Having said that  I got the FE edition. I haven t seen any difference than what the other versions offer. It s just less expensive.
Does not read sim card. I got the same phone from my cell provider and it works great and read the sim perfectly. Just pay a few dollars more and get one that works. NOT THIS ONE.2/6/21 UPDATE: I sent this phone back 2 months ago and STILL HAVE NO REFUND. I have contacted the seller and amazon with not even so much as a response back. Buyer beware!
Have had this phone for about 2 months now and nothing but happy! Has good speed on our wireless network  clear calls  better photos than I ever expected from a phone!Not even a little regretful about this purchase.
Love this phone! great replacement for my old phone and very happy that I could take my sim card out if my old phone and put in this phone. Skipped Verizons upcharge and high phone price and I may never buy a phone from them again lol. Glad I made this purchase. This phone also had SD slot for those that need that like I do... The face recognition and fingerprint security work great too.
It is simply great!!!
I have had my s8+ for a couple a years now and it was time for a upgrade. I wanted a new phone  not to pricey  but better than my old phone. In my opinion  the s20 fe is great. No problem what so ever and it is working well for me. No damage and fast shipping.
No receipt. Phone box had been previously opened the seal was broken the instruction papers all undone out of box. Fingerprints on phone where someone had taken cellophane off previously. Thought I was purchasing a new phone that I could get a manufactures warranty  but you have to have a receipt and a new product.
It s a good all around phone. It has a lot of  flagship  features for a decent price. The in screen fingerprint reader is a little tricky to find until you get used to it. It has a good screen  cameras  processor  and battery. It s also nice to have a choice of six colors.
We moved from a Samsung Galaxy S 5 to the S 20 FE. Major leap in upgrade technology. Our 1st time buying an unlocked phone. Few hurdles for a couple of weeks. Now  still learning about all of the things I have NEVER heard of.Great Move on our part.
The sceen went out exactly 2 months after it was delivered. I ve tried rebooting it  that does not work. This is terrible.
It is a little taller than I would have liked. I used to have a s5 phone. Other than that so far so good. Battery seems to be lasting good. I think getting a case for it will help with the handling of the phone. A little slippery without one.
La batería  cámaras  son geniales tiene todas las funciones de un flagship tal como sus hermanos mayores los s20  la fluidez de la pantalla a 128 hertz es genial  sin embargo con la última actualización he notado algo de lag al momento de abrir la aplicación de la cámara  espero mejore con actualizaciones futuras  y si o si es necesario usar vidrio templado ya que con el poco tiempo que llevo de uso y haciendo énfasis que lo he cuidado bastante  sin embargo ya tengo varios rayones y hasta en el vidrio de la parte de la cámara así que si o si vidrios templados para pantalla y modulo de cámara!
I am not sure if this is specific to my phone or not but I am missing wifi calling. I spent well over an hour chatting with samsung reps and could not resolve the issue. There is no setting to turn it on and it is not automatically turned on. They claim that their unlocked phones dont get it. I live in a place with poor cell signal so this is a HUGE problem for me. Also it wont even send texts unless you have at least LTE. I have had 2 bars and it wont send a text. Who would have thought than an S series phone would be missing such a critical feature.
The phone was great for the first 6 months but now it randomly won t charge saying it has moisture in the place where the charger connects. It s not been near any moisture and a professional looked at it under a microscope and couldn t find anything wrong. Really sucks because it cost a lot of money and it can t be returned.
I bought this to replace the Pixel 3aXL I dropped. This is fine phone with excellent 5G features that has most of the features of the new premium phones for less than half the cost. It does come with the usual amount of Samsung crapware pre-installed  which was expected. All in all  I m happy with my purchase.
What a great phone and value. If you re looking for a flagship phone minus just a very few bells and whistles look no further. This phone is amazing  fast and has a great camera and features. Came unlocked as advertised. Did the transfer from my old S7 by myself with no problems. Highly recommended! Saved a lot of money!!!
